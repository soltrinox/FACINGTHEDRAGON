# APPENDIX: WORKBOOK

## A. WRITING YOUR LIFE: A CATHARTIC BIOGRAPHY

This section transforms your life experiences into a powerful autobiography that serves as both healing tool and testament to your growth. You'll learn to approach your story with honesty, curiosity, and compassion, understanding that writing your biography is about identity reconstruction, not perfection. This section provides step-by-step guidance for excavating the psychological roots beneath events, identifying cognitive biases formed in childhood, and using the "Three You's" technique to give voice to different developmental stages. You'll discover how to write with emotional truth while maintaining perspective, turning painful memories into sources of wisdom and strength. This process helps you reclaim ownership of your narrative, process trauma safely, and create a roadmap for your future self, transforming your story from one of victimhood to one of conscious evolution and empowerment.

## A.1 Introduction: Why Your Story Matters

**Subsection Overview:** Understanding the transformative power of autobiography as self-authorship. This subsection establishes that your life story belongs to you first, not the world, and that writing while incarcerated gives deeper meaning to inner transformation when physical movement is limited.
Before you write a single word, understand this:
Your life story is not just what happened to you, it's what you decide to make of it.

A biography is usually someone else writing about your life.
But this book is different.

This is your autobiography, written by you, from inside your mind, your history, your pain, your victories, and your truth. Writing it while incarcerated gives it even deeper meaning, because when your physical movement is limited, your inner world becomes your territory.

Why this matters:

    - It gives you ownership of your narrative.
    - It helps you process what you've survived.
    - It gives you clarity about your patterns, your influences, and your future.
    - It allows you to speak back to the world that has spoken for you far too often.

This manual will walk you step-by-step through building a full biography that is emotionally honest, psychologically insightful, structured, readable, and powerful.

## A.2 How to Approach the Project

**Subsection Overview:** Learning the foundational mindset for biographical writing focused on reflection rather than mere fact-telling. This subsection teaches you to approach your story with honesty, curiosity, compassion, courage, and patience while understanding that biography is identity reconstruction, not perfection.
This project is about reflection, not just remembering facts.
The aim is to understand:

    - Where your emotional responses come from

    - How your environment shaped you

    - Where your cognitive biases were formed

    - How earlier wounds created later behavior

    - What you have learned

    - What you want your future to be

Writing a biography is not about perfection.
It’s about identity reconstruction.

### A.2.1 The Mindset You Need

**Subsection Overview:** Establishing the five essential attitudes for honest biographical writing: honesty even when painful, curiosity as self-investigation, compassion toward your younger self, courage to face uncomfortable truths, and patience for the understanding process.
Approach this writing project with:

    - Honesty, even if it hurts

    - Curiosity, as if you're investigating your own life

    - Compassion, speak to your younger self as if you cared about him

    - Courage, because the truth is often uncomfortable

    - Patience, because understanding yourself takes time

### A.2.2 What This Biography Is Not

**Subsection Overview:** Clarifying what your autobiography should avoid becoming: not a legal defense, pity story, justification, brag book, or approval-seeking document. Understanding that this biography belongs to you first, not the world.

    - Not a legal defense

    - Not a pity story

    - Not a justification

    - Not a brag book

    - Not something you write for approval

This biography belongs to you first, not the world.

### A.2.3 What This Biography Is

**Subsection Overview:** Defining the positive purpose of your autobiography as guided self-excavation, psychological mapping, personal healing tool, evolutionary record, and testimony of transformation. Understanding biography as empowerment and self-discovery.

    - A guided self-excavation

    - A psychological map of your life

    - A personal healing tool

    - A record of your evolution

    - A testimony of who you are becoming

## A.3 How to Dig Into Your Psychology and Roots

**Subsection Overview:** Learning to understand the psychological layers beneath life events. This subsection teaches you to identify what happened, what you felt, what you believed, what it meant, how it shaped your worldview, and how it influenced later decisions.
To write a meaningful biography, you must understand the roots beneath the events.
Every chapter of your life has layers:
    - What happened

    - What you felt

    - What you believed at the time

    - What it meant to you

    - How it shaped your worldview

    - How it influenced later decisions

This section teaches you to identify those layers.

### A.3.1 The "Origins of Self" Method

**Subsection Overview:** A systematic approach to understanding how major memories shaped your beliefs and patterns. This method helps uncover attachment wounds, trust patterns, fear responses, internalized shame, automatic thoughts, survival strategies, and cognitive distortions through targeted questioning.
For every major memory, ask:
    - What did I learn about the world from this?

    - What did I learn about myself?

    - What emotion did I attach to this kind of situation?

    - What belief did I form?

    - What did I expect from people after this?

    - How did I protect myself?

This helps you uncover:
    - Attachment wounds

    - Trust patterns

    - Fear responses

    - Internalized shame

    - Automatic thoughts

    - Survival strategies

    - Cognitive distortions

You are not just telling the memory.
You are explaining the psychological imprint it left.

### A.3.2 The "Three You's" Technique

**Subsection Overview:** Understanding how to give voice to different developmental stages in your story: the emotional, reactive Child You; the proving, masking Teen/Young Adult You; and the reflective Present-Day You who can reinterpret experiences with wisdom and clarity.
Every life story has three versions of you:
    - The Child You
    - Emotional, reactive, absorbing everything
    - Forming beliefs before you had tools
    - **The Teen / Young Adult You**
        - Trying to prove something
        - Acting fast, thinking later
        - Masking pain with behavior
        - Seeking belonging
    - **The Present-Day You**
        - Looking back with more clarity
        - Able to understand cause and effect
        - Capable of rewriting your interpretations
Your biography must allow all three voices to speak, but they don’t all speak the same way.

Example:
    - The child you says: “I felt alone.”
    - The teen you says: “So I didn’t trust anybody.”
    - The adult you says: “That wound followed me into everything.”
This deepens your writing with emotional truth.

### A.3.3 Understanding Cognitive Bias Through Your Story

**Subsection Overview:** Identifying mental shortcuts and distorted thinking patterns learned in childhood. This subsection helps you recognize biases like "People always leave" or "Anger protects me" and understand their origins, survival value, and current impact on your life.
Everyone has cognitive biases, mental shortcuts that distort reality.
Most are learned in childhood.

Examples:
    - "People always leave."
    - "I have to defend myself first."
    - "Nobody cares unless I prove myself."
    - "When I feel disrespected, I must react."
    - "Anger protects me."

As you write each chapter, ask:
    - What bias was I operating from?
    - Where did that bias come from?
    - Did it help me survive?
    - Did it later harm me?
    - Do I still need it?
This is how you turn reflection into transformation.

## B. THE FULL 10-PART BIOGRAPHY OUTLINE

This section gives you the complete roadmap to write your autobiography.

Each part includes:
- What to write
- Reflection exercises
- Psychological questions
- Emotional prompts
- Structural guidance

By the time you finish all 10 parts, you will have a full book manuscript.

### B.1: PART I: TITLE PAGE + AUTHOR'S STATEMENT

Before the story starts, write a one-page statement explaining:
- Why you're writing this
- Who you're writing for (yourself or others)
- What you hope to understand
- What changed inside you to make you ready to tell your story

This is not a confession.
It is a declaration of self-authorship.

### B.2: PART II: EARLIEST MEMORY: "THE FIRST WORLD I LIVED IN"

**What to write:**
- Start with your earliest clear memory.
- Not the event, the feeling of the world at that age.

**Describe:**
- What your home felt like
- What you believed about safety
- What you believed about love
- Who protected you
- Who scared you
- What you wanted most as a child

**Deep questions:**
- What did you learn about whether people were safe?
- What emotions were "allowed" and what emotions were punished?
- What role did you play in your family (protector, troublemaker, quiet one)?
- What masks did you learn to wear?

### B.3: PART III: FAMILY HISTORY: THE SOIL YOU GREW FROM

**Write about:**
- Parents
- Grandparents
- Siblings
- Anyone who shaped you
- Not just what they did, but what emotional world they passed down.

**Questions:**
- What unspoken rules governed your family?
- What pain did you inherit that wasn't yours?
- What generational patterns do you now see?
- What behaviors were normal then that you now question?

**Goal:**
Show the reader how you became the person you were shaped to be.

### B.4: PART IV: CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES THAT LEFT MARKS

Every child is shaped by:
- Praise
- Criticism
- Silence
- Violence
- Neglect
- Encouragement
- Chaos
- Stability

Pick 5–10 memories that permanently influenced your beliefs or patterns.

**For each memory, write:**
- What happened
- What you felt
- What you believed because of it
- How you protected yourself
- How you act today because of that memory

This section creates the emotional foundation of your life story.

### B.5: PART V: ADOLESCENCE: THE FORGING YEARS

This is where cognitive biases, trauma responses, and identity conflicts usually erupt.

**Write about:**
- Your desire to belong
- Your search for respect
- Your anger
- The moment you first felt "grown"
- The first time you felt misunderstood
- Times you felt humiliated
- Times you felt powerful
- Times you felt invisible

**Reflection prompts:**
- Who did you try to impress?
- Where did you feel safest?
- What mask did you wear for survival?
- What pain were you hiding?
- What path were you walking toward without realizing it?

Adolescence is the psychological storm where many life trajectories begin.

### B.6: PART VI: MOMENTS OF DECISION

Every life has choice points.

Write about 4–8 decisions or turning points that shaped your path, whether good or bad.

**For each:**
- The situation
- What you felt
- The beliefs driving your choice
- What other path was available
- Why that path felt impossible
- The hidden emotion underneath
- What you would tell your younger self now

This is where you confront the deepest emotional truth:
Most destructive decisions come from pain, not evil.

### B.7: PART VII: CRISIS, LOSS, AND CONSEQUENCES

**Write honestly about:**
- Your darkest moments
- The consequences of your actions
- People you hurt
- People who hurt you
- Your lowest emotional state
- The moment you hit bottom

But do NOT write this section with shame.
Write it with understanding.

**Questions:**
- What emotion was I trying to avoid?
- What wound was I reenacting?
- What belief controlled me?
- What version of me made that choice, the child, the teen, or the adult?

This chapter is where truth becomes healing.

### B.8: PART VIII: INCARCERATION: THE STILLNESS WHERE REFLECTION BEGINS

**Write about:**

- The shock of being locked up
- The frustration
- The fear
- The anger
- The numbness
- The time you first faced yourself
- The thought loop you keep repeating
- The person you are becoming inside
- The person you want to become after

This is not about legal details.
This is about internal transformation.

**Reflection prompts:**

- What have you faced about yourself that the outside world distracted you from?
- What masks have you removed?
- What childhood beliefs do you now see differently?
- Which habits of thought are you trying to break?
- What version of yourself are you building?

### B.9: PART IX: RECONSTRUCTION: WHO YOU ARE NOW

This chapter is about rebuilding:

- Your identity
- Your values
- Your emotional intelligence
- Your understanding of yourself
- Your definition of manhood
- Your sense of responsibility
- Your capacity for empathy

**Questions:**

- What do you now understand about your past that you didn't then?
- How has your emotional vocabulary grown?
- What beliefs have you let go of?
- What have you forgiven yourself for?
- What do you still need to heal?

This is where you separate:
- Who you were

from

- Who you choose to be.

### B.10: PART X: THE FUTURE CHAPTER

End your biography with a chapter called:
**"The Man I Intend to Become"**

**This includes:**
- Your commitments
- Your values
- Your vision for your life
- The relationships you want to repair
- The younger version of you you finally understand
- The message you would send to someone walking the path you walked

This chapter transforms the biography into a testament of growth.

## C. PRACTICAL WRITING INSTRUCTIONS

### C.1: How to Write Inside a Cell

You don't need a laptop.
You need:
- A notebook
- A pen
- A quiet hour
- A willingness to face yourself

Commit to writing one page per day.
In 12 months you will have written a full book.

### C.2: Writing Techniques

**Write in Scenes**

Don't just describe, recreate:
- What the room looked like
- The sound in the background
- What you felt in your chest
- What your hands were doing
- What you hoped would happen

**Use the "Feelings Wheel" Method**

For every scene, identify:
- Primary emotion
- Secondary emotion
- Hidden emotion

Many men only recognize anger, but underneath there is:
- hurt
- fear
- shame
- sadness
- confusion

Put all emotions into words.

### C.3: How to Write Without Judging Yourself

When a painful memory comes up, write:
- "At that time, I believed…"
- "At that time, I didn't understand…"
- "At that time, I was protecting myself from…"

You are not writing to punish yourself.
You are writing to free yourself.

### C.4: How to Stay Honest

Ask yourself:
- Does this make me look better than I was?
- Am I leaving out parts because they hurt?
- Am I afraid of how someone will see me?
- Am I writing the truth or a performance?

**Your biography is not a resume.**
It is surgery.

### C.5: How to Handle Emotional Overload

If you feel overwhelmed:
- Stop writing
- Breathe slowly
- Stand up
- Drink water
- Return when ready

Pain that is written becomes pain that is processed.

## D. ADVANCED SELF-REFLECTION TECHNIQUES

These methods help you go even deeper.

### D.1: Dialogue with Your Younger Self

Write conversations between:
- Present you
- Younger you

**Ask him:**
- What did you need?
- What scared you?
- What made you feel small?
- What did you wish an adult would notice?

Then write what you wish you could have told him.

This creates emotional integration.

### D.2: The "Root Cause Tree" Technique

Pick any self-destructive behavior.

**Draw:**
- The behavior (top of the tree)
- The emotion causing it (branches)
- The belief under the emotion (roots)
- The memory that created the belief (deep roots)

Now explore how the belief shaped your life.

### D.3: Rewriting Your Interpretations

Write:
- "I used to believe _______ because ________. Now I understand _______."

This rewrites your inner narrative.

### D.4: Identifying Your Protective Personas

Many incarcerated men have these "masks":
- The Tough Persona
- The Angry Persona
- The Numb Persona
- The Silent Persona
- The Fearless Persona
- The I-don't-care Persona

**Write about each one:**
- When it first appeared
- What it protected
- What it cost you
- Whether you still need it

## E. TURNING THE BIOGRAPHY INTO A COHERENT BOOK

This helps you organize your chapters, revise, and polish.

### E.1: Structure of Your Final Book

You can structure your autobiography this way:
- Introduction / Author's Statement
- Childhood World
- Family History
- Important Childhood Memories
- Adolescence
- Decisions
- Crisis
- Incarceration
- Reconstruction
- Future Chapter

### E.2: Editing Without Losing Emotion

When revising:
- Keep the raw emotion
- Replace unclear sentences
- Add more detail where needed
- Remove unnecessary filler
- Keep your voice authentic

### E.3: Maintaining Emotional Truth

**Do not:**
- Overdramatize
- Over-explain
- Over-defend

**Do:**
- Tell what you felt
- Tell what you believed
- Tell how you changed

Emotion is the core.
Honesty is the power.
Reflection is the meaning.

## F. CLOSING: THE PURPOSE OF YOUR BIOGRAPHY

Your story is not defined by your mistakes.
Your biography is not about guilt, it is about growth.

Writing your life story gives you:
- Perspective
- Healing
- Emotional literacy
- A sense of identity
- A path forward
- A way to help others

One day, someone who feels broken, lost, angry, confused, fatherless, abandoned, or hopeless will read your story and think:
"If he could rewrite his life, maybe I can too."

This may become the most important thing you ever create.

## J. FULL TRAUMA-INFORMED WRITING GUIDE

A complete self-directed method for safely exploring the past, understanding trauma, and transforming identity through writing.

This guide is divided into 12 modules, each with:
- Purpose
- Theory (simple, understandable)
- Writing method
- Safety instructions
- Prompts
- Closing exercises

He can work on one module per day, week, or month, whatever pace he can emotionally handle.

### J.1: MODULE 1: HOW TRAUMA SHOWS UP IN MEMORY

**Purpose**

Understand trauma in simple terms so it can be written about without fear.

**Core Idea**

Trauma isn't "the bad thing that happened."
Trauma is what stayed inside you afterward (the meaning, the belief, the emotion, the fear, the shame).

**Writing Method**

Describe one event only in terms of sensations, not thoughts.

"What I remember with my body…"
- The room felt…
- My chest felt…
- My stomach felt…
- My hands were…
- The sound I heard was…

**Safety Note**

If your heart races or you feel overwhelmed, pause.
Tell yourself:
- "I am safe now."
- "This memory cannot hurt me anymore."

Then continue only when stable.

**Prompts**

- The earliest moment my body tensed was…
- Something that scared me before I had words for fear was…

### J.2: MODULE 2: UNDERSTANDING HOW TRAUMA SHAPES BELIEFS

**Purpose**

Identify the beliefs you formed as a child that still control your reactions today.

**Core Idea**

Children interpret events emotionally, not logically.
Those interpretations turn into lifelong beliefs:
- "I'm alone."
- "Anger is safer than vulnerability."
- "People leave."
- "I have to defend myself."

**Writing Method**

For each traumatic memory, write:
- What I saw
- What I believed at that time
- What I still believe today
- What I wish I could tell that younger version of myself

**Prompts**

- A belief that once protected me but now hurts me is…
- I learned to expect people to ______ because ______.

### J.3: MODULE 3: IDENTIFYING THE "TRAUMA VOICE" VS. THE "ADULT VOICE"

**Purpose**

Separating the emotional child from the logical adult.

**Core Idea**

The "trauma voice" speaks in extremes:
- "Always."
- "Never."
- "Everyone."
- "Nobody."

The adult voice is calmer and more flexible.

**Writing Method**

Write a conversation between the Trauma Voice and the Adult Voice.

**Prompts**

## L. "DIALOGUE WITH YOUR YOUNGER SELF" GUIDED JOURNAL

A deep, compassionate, trauma-informed, identity-reconstruction journaling method.

### INTRODUCTION: WHY SPEAK TO YOUR YOUNGER SELF

Everyone carries different versions of themselves inside, the child who learned what pain was, the teenager who learned how to survive, the young adult who acted from fear or confusion, and the present-day self who is finally trying to understand.

This guided journal teaches you how to talk with your younger selves, not about them.
It is based on three principles:
- Every version of you deserves a voice.
- Your younger selves survived things you could not explain back then.
- Healing comes when the adult you becomes the protector the child you never had.

When you talk to your younger self, you are not rewriting history, you are repairing the relationship between your past and your present.

This journal will teach you:
- How to bring younger versions of yourself into clear focus
- How to give them permission to speak the emotions they couldn't back then
- How to comfort, guide, and understand them
- How to retrieve the strength, innocence, and hope you lost
- How to release the anger, shame, or confusion still inside them

You will have conversations with…
- The Early Child You (ages 3–7)
- The Older Child You (ages 8–12)
- The Teen You (ages 13–19)
- The Young Adult You (20s)
- The Past-You-Who-Made-Mistakes
- The Self-You-Still-Feel-Sorry-For
- The Self-You-Still-Haven't-Forgiven

And finally, you will write to…
- The Future You
- The Man You Are Becoming

Use this as slowly or quickly as you want.
There is no wrong pace and no wrong way.

### L.1: MEETING YOUR YOUNGER SELF

**Exercise 1: The First Encounter**
Find a quiet moment.
Picture yourself at age 5, standing somewhere familiar, a kitchen, a bedroom, a playground, a living room.

Close your eyes and imagine:
    - What clothes is he wearing?
    - What expression is on his face?
    - What is he holding?
    - What emotion do you see in his eyes?
    - Does he look like he needs something?

Now, write the scene:

**Prompt:** Describe the moment you meet your 5-year-old self for the first time.
Don't speak yet, just observe him.

**Exercise 2: Let Him Speak First**
Imagine kneeling down to his level and saying:
“I’m here. You can tell me anything.”

Now let him speak.

**Prompt:** What does the 5-year-old you say when he finally feels safe enough to talk?
Write his words exactly as they come.

**Exercise 3: Your Response**
Now speak back to him softly:
    - What does he need to hear?
    - What fear do you want to take off his shoulders?
    - What truth do you want to give him?

**Prompt:** What do you say to your 5-year-old self to comfort him, protect him, and let him know he wasn't alone?
### L.2: THE CHILD WHO LEARNED FEAR (AGES 6–9)
Children do not "understand" the world, they absorb it.
Fear at this age becomes the blueprint for how we protect ourselves later.

**Exercise 4: The Fear Memory**
Picture yourself at age 6–9 during a moment of fear:
    - A loud argument
    - A punishment
    - Being left alone
    - A big embarrassment
    - Something said to you
    - Something done to you
    - Something you witnessed

Now write:

**Prompt:** Describe the first moment in childhood when you felt afraid or unsafe.

**Exercise 5: Let the Child Speak**
Ask him:
    - "What scared you the most?"
    - "What did you think would happen?"
    - "Who did you hope would help you?"
    - "What did you tell yourself to survive it?"

**Prompt:** Write the child's full response as if he is speaking right now.

**Exercise 6: Your Adult Response**
Speak with patience and gentleness.

**Prompt:** What does your present-day self say to that scared child?
What protection, safety, or reassurance do you give?

### L.3: THE CHILD WHO LEARNED SHAME (AGES 8–12)
This age is when children learn what is "acceptable" or "wrong," often based on the reactions of adults, not on truth.

Shame becomes the deepest wound because it feels like “something is wrong with ME.”

**Exercise 7: The Shame Memory**
Think of a moment you felt:
    - Embarrassed
    - Rejected
    - Unwanted
    - Mocked
    - Punished unfairly
    - Compared to others
    - Scolded for something normal

**Prompt:** Describe the childhood moment that first taught you shame.

**Exercise 8: Ask Him What He Believed**
Shame creates beliefs like:
“I’m not enough.”

“I’m unlovable.”

“I’m stupid.”

“I’m not good.”

"They were right about me."

**Prompt:** What belief did your child self form from that moment?

**Exercise 9: Rewrite the Shame**
Now say:
"You were never the problem."

Then rewrite the event, not changing the facts, but changing the meaning.

**Prompt:** Rewrite the shame memory from the perspective of the adult who knows better.

### L.4: THE TEEN WHO LEARNED TO SURVIVE (AGES 13–19)
Teen years are where trauma turns into behavior.
This version of you:
    - Learned to hide feelings
    - Learned to react instead of express
    - Developed patterns he thought would protect him
    - Felt the pressure to be “strong”
    - Wanted belonging
    - Wanted respect
    - Wanted escape
    - Wanted love but didn’t know how to ask for it

**Exercise 10: Meet the Teen Version of You**
Picture him:
    - His posture
    - His attitude
    - His eyes
    - His anger
    - His exhaustion
    - His loneliness he'd never admit

**Prompt:** Describe your teen-self as if he walked into the room right now.

**Exercise 11: Let Him Speak**
Ask him:
    - "What were you trying to prove?"
    - "What hurt were you hiding?"
    - "What did no one understand about you?"

**Prompt:** Write the teen's raw, unfiltered answers. Do not censor him.

**Exercise 12: Your Adult Response**
Speak from compassion, not authority.

Say things like:
    - “You didn’t know how to ask for help.”
    - “You were carrying too much for your age.”
    - “Your anger made sense.”
    - "You were protecting yourself the only way you knew."

**Prompt:** Write what the adult-you says to help the teen-you feel understood.

### L.5: THE VERSION OF YOU WHO MADE MISTAKES
This is one of the hardest self-dialogues, but also the most healing.

**Exercise 13: Meet the Version of You During Your Lowest Choices**
Picture him:
    - The confusion
    - The fear
    - The impulsivity
    - The pain disguised as anger
    - The numbness
    - The desperation
    - The lack of guidance
    - The loneliness

**Prompt:** Describe that version of yourself without judgment. Who was he emotionally?

**Exercise 14: Let Him Tell His Truth**
Ask him:
    - “What were you feeling in that moment?”
    - “What were you trying to run from?”
    - “What did you need that you didn’t have?”
    - "What did you wish someone had told you?"

**Prompt:** Write the full dialogue as if he were confessing his real emotions for the first time.

**Exercise 15: Your Response, Not Excusing, but Understanding**
Speak from clarity:
"You were wrong, but you weren't evil."

“You acted from fear, pain, or survival.”

“You were doing the best you could with the limited tools you had.”

"You aren't that version anymore."

**Prompt:** Write a letter to that version of you expressing understanding, accountability, and forgiveness.
### L.6: THE SELF YOU HAVEN'T FORGIVEN
Everyone has a version of themselves they still resent or punish.

**Exercise 16: Identify Him**

**Prompt:** Which version of yourself do you still hold anger toward? Describe him.

**Exercise 17: Let Him Speak About His Regrets**
Ask him:
    - "What do you regret?"
    - "What do you wish you knew back then?"
    - "What punishment have you given yourself?"

**Prompt:** Write his confession.

**Exercise 18: Release the Judgment**
Forgiveness is not approval. It is releasing the burden.

**Prompt:** What would forgiveness release from your heart, your body, your future?
### L.7: THE CURRENT YOU SPEAKS
Now bring all versions of yourself into the same room.

**Exercise 19: A Conversation Among All Selves**
Write a roundtable dialogue:
    - Child
    - Older child
    - Teen
    - The version who made mistakes
    - The version who feels shame
    - Your present-day self

**Prompt:** Let each version speak one sentence about what they needed and what they still carry.
Then let your present self respond.

### L.8: THE FUTURE YOU
Meet the man you will become.

**Exercise 20: Introduce Yourself to Your Future Self**

**Prompt:** Describe the man you want to become in 10 years.
    - His peace
    - His strength
    - His maturity
    - His emotional stability
    - His values
    - His relationships
    - His purpose

**Exercise 21: Let the Future You Speak Back**
Imagine him saying:
“I’m proud of you for choosing to evolve.”
“You didn’t waste your pain.”
"You became someone your younger selves deserved."

**Prompt:** Write a full message from your future self to you.
### L.9: CLOSING RITUAL

Complete this paragraph:

"I honor the child I was,
the teen I became,
the young man who tried to survive,
and the man I am becoming.
I reclaim every piece of me."

Sign it with your name.

This closes the dialogue.
