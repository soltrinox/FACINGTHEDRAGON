## **The Waterfall**

The grandfather gestured toward the darkness beyond their camp, as if pointing to some distant landmark. "A man who does not tend to his emotions becomes overwhelmed by them," he said. "Let me tell you a story about when I learned this the hard way."

He settled deeper into his position, the fire casting shadows across his weathered face. "I was seventeen, maybe eighteen. There was a waterfall in the northern ridge, small at the top where the stream began, but roaring at the bottom where it crashed into the valley. I used to go there to think, but the sound of it, that constant, unending roar, it made me feel things I didn't want to feel. It reminded me of everything I was trying to forget."

The grandson shifted, listening intently as his grandfather's voice took on the cadence of memory.

"I had been taught that a man shows strength by controlling his emotions, by not letting them show. My father's friend, a man named Kael, had reinforced this. 'Real men don't feel,' he'd tell me. 'Real men act. Emotions are weakness.' So when I felt anger at my father's absence, or sadness at my mother's death, or fear about the future, I did what I thought was strong: I dammed them up. I told myself I didn't care. I told myself it didn't matter. I told myself I was fine."

The old man's hands moved as if stacking stones. "The waterfall became my enemy. Every time I heard it roar, it felt like my own emotions were screaming at me, demanding to be heard. So I decided to silence it. I spent three days building a dam above the falls, stacking rocks and logs, packing mud between them. I worked until my hands bled, until my back ached, until I could barely stand. But I was determined. I would control this. I would make it quiet."

"On the third day, an old woman from the nearby village found me there. Her name was Mara, and she had lived by that waterfall for sixty years. She watched me work for a long time before speaking."

"'What are you doing, boy?' she asked."

"'Making it quiet,' I told her, not looking up from my work."

"'Why?'"

"'Because I can't think with all this noise,' I snapped. 'Because I need it to be still.'"

"Mara moved closer, her eyes studying the structure I was building. 'The water has flowed here for a thousand years,' she said quietly. 'It feeds the fields below. It gives life to the valley. What do you think will happen if you stop it?'"

"'It will be quiet,' I said stubbornly. 'That's what I want.'"

"'And what of the pressure?' she asked. 'What of the water that continues to flow from the mountains? Where will it go?'"

"'I don't care,' I told her, and I meant it. I was so focused on silencing the roar that I couldn't see beyond my own need for control."

"Mara shook her head. 'You cannot stop a river by blocking it, young man. You can only delay the flood. The water will find a way, and when it does, it will destroy everything in its path.'"

"'You don't understand,' I said, my voice rising. 'I need this. I need the silence. I can't, ' I stopped myself, refusing to finish the thought. I couldn't admit that the waterfall's roar reminded me of my own suppressed pain, my own unacknowledged grief."

"'What can't you do?' Mara pressed gently."

"'Nothing,' I said, turning back to my work. 'I'm fine. I just want it quiet.'"

"She watched me for another hour, then left without another word. I finished the dam that evening. For a day, there was silence. The waterfall stopped roaring. The stream above the dam became a still pool, and I sat there, thinking I had won. I had controlled it. I had proven my strength."

The grandfather's voice grew heavy. "But on the second day, I noticed the water level rising. The pool was growing, spreading beyond its banks. The pressure was building against my dam, and I could hear the structure groaning. Still, I refused to acknowledge it. I told myself it would hold. I had built it strong. I had built it right."

"On the third day, Mara returned. She brought with her a man from the village, a farmer whose fields lay below the falls."

"'You must release the water,' the farmer said, his voice urgent. 'The dam is weakening. If it breaks, it will flood my fields, destroy my crops, wash away my home.'"

"'It will hold,' I insisted, though even I could hear the doubt in my own voice. The dam was creaking now, water seeping through cracks I hadn't noticed before."

"'Listen to me, boy,' Mara said, her voice sharp for the first time. 'You built this dam because you were afraid of the waterfall's roar. But the roar was just the sound of water doing what water must do, flow. You cannot stop emotions any more than you can stop a river. They will find a way out, and the longer you block them, the more destructive they become.'"

"'I'm not afraid,' I lied. 'I just wanted it quiet.'"

"'Then why are your hands shaking?' she asked. 'Why won't you look at me? Why did you spend three days building this instead of facing whatever it is that the waterfall's roar reminds you of?'"

"I felt something crack inside me then, not the dam, but something in my chest. Anger, hot and sharp, flooded through me. 'You don't know anything about me!' I shouted. 'You don't know what I've lost, what I've had to endure! You don't know what it's like to have to be strong all the time, to never show weakness, to never let anyone see that you're hurting!'"

"The words came pouring out, and as they did, I realized I was crying. Years of suppressed grief, anger, fear, all of it breaking through the dam I had built inside myself. I collapsed to my knees, sobbing in a way I hadn't allowed myself to since I was a child."

"Mara knelt beside me, placing a hand on my shoulder. 'There,' she said softly. 'There it is. The water you've been trying to dam. It needed to flow, didn't it?'"

"As I wept, I heard a sound that made my blood run cold: a deep, groaning crack. The dam was breaking."

"We all turned to see water beginning to pour through the fractures. 'Run!' the farmer shouted, and we scrambled up the ridge just as the dam gave way completely."

"The explosion of water was terrifying. It didn't just flow, it surged, a wall of destruction that tore through everything in its path. Trees were uprooted. Boulders were thrown like pebbles. The farmer's fields were flooded, his crops destroyed. The waterfall's roar returned, but now it was mixed with the sound of destruction."

"I stood there, watching the devastation I had caused, and I understood. The water had to flow. By trying to stop it, I had only delayed the inevitable and made it far worse. The pressure I had built up had created a force far more destructive than the natural waterfall ever was."

"Mara stood beside me, watching the flood. 'Do you see now?' she asked. 'The waterfall was never your enemy. It was just water, flowing as water must. Your emotions are the same. They are not your enemy. They are information. They tell you what matters, what threatens you, what you need, what you value. When you feel anger, it's telling you that something important has been violated. When you feel sadness, it's honoring what you've lost. When you feel fear, it's protecting you from danger.'"

"'But I was taught that emotions are weakness,' I said, my voice small."

"'Who taught you that?' she asked."

"'Kael. My father's friend. He said real men don't feel.'"

"'And what do you think now?'"

"I looked at the destruction below us. 'I think real men acknowledge what they feel. I think suppression isn't strength, it's just delayed destruction.'"

"Mara nodded. 'The water must flow, but it doesn't have to flood. You can channel it. You can let it nourish instead of destroy. But first, you must acknowledge it exists. You must let yourself feel it, name it, understand what it's telling you. Only then can you direct it in ways that serve you instead of destroy you.'"


He looked at his grandson. "That's what I learned that day: suppression is not strength. Containment is not control. Stillness is not healing. Your emotions are not your enemy, grandson. They are information. They tell you what matters to you, what threatens you, what you need, what you value. When you feel anger, it's telling you that something important to you has been violated. When you feel fear, it's protecting you from danger. When you feel sadness, it's honoring what you've lost. When you feel shame, it's asking you to examine whether you've acted in alignment with your values."

He leaned forward, his voice urgent. "But when you dam these feelings, when you refuse to acknowledge them, when you tell yourself 'I don't care' or 'It doesn't matter' or 'I'm fine', the pressure builds. And when it finally breaks through, it destroys everything in its path. I've seen strong men crumble because they spent decades refusing to feel, and then one day, the dam burst and they couldn't stop the flood."

"You must let the water flow, not swallow villages, but nourish them. When you feel something, acknowledge it: 'I'm angry because...' 'I'm hurt because...' 'I'm afraid because...' This releases pressure gradually, nourishing relationships rather than destroying them. The waterfall will always roar, but you can learn to hear it as information, not as a threat. Suppression isn't strength; conscious expression is."

**THE LESSON:** This parable teaches that **suppressed emotions don't disappear, they accumulate and explode**. Emotions are information about what matters, not enemies to eliminate. Damming them creates pressure that eventually erupts with devastating force. This involves **survival mode thinking** (believing suppression equals strength) and **emotional reasoning** (confusing feeling with weakness). The waterfall represents natural emotional flow; the dam represents forced suppression. When the dam bursts, violence, rage, coldness, and destruction follow, harming oneself and those one loves. **Technique:** The warrior must let emotions flow in healthy ways rather than suppressing them. When he feels something, he must acknowledge it: "I'm angry because..." "I'm hurt because..." "I'm afraid because..." This releases pressure gradually, nourishing relationships rather than destroying them. Suppression isn't strength; conscious expression is.
