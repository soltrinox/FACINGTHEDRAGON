## **The Blacksmith's Tongs**

The grandfather mimed holding tongs, adjusting his grip to demonstrate. "Control is not about gripping tightly, it is about knowing when to let go," he said. "A blacksmith uses tongs to hold molten metal. If he grips too tightly, he leaves marks that weaken the steel. If he grips too loosely, the metal slips and shatters. The blacksmith must hold with calm firmness, not too much, not too little. This taught me something profound: Control is balance, not domination."

He set down his invisible tongs and looked at his grandson with the weight of memory. "I learned this lesson the hard way, when I was not much older than you. Let me tell you the story of how I discovered what the tongs truly meant."

The grandfather settled back, his eyes seeing a time long past. "When I was seventeen, I apprenticed under Master Kael, the finest blacksmith in three villages. I was eager, ambitious, and terrified of failure. I thought control meant never letting go, never allowing anything to slip from my grasp."

He paused, a shadow crossing his face. "I had a friend then, a young man named Renn. We had grown up together, trained together, shared everything. But Renn was different, he was wild, unpredictable, always pushing boundaries. Where I sought order, he embraced freedom."

"One evening, Renn came to me with a plan. He wanted to leave our village, to travel to the capital and join the royal guard. He asked me to come with him. I was terrified, not of the journey, but of losing him, of being left behind. So I tried to control him."

The grandfather's voice took on the tone of his younger self, desperate and tight. "'You can't go,' I told him. 'It's too dangerous. Stay here where it's safe, where I can protect you.'"

"Renn looked at me with confusion, then pity. 'Protect me from what? From living? From choosing my own path? You're not protecting me, you're trying to cage me.'"

"'I'm trying to keep you safe!' I insisted. 'You're my friend. I can't lose you. If you go, you'll get hurt, you'll fail. Stay here with me.'"

"Renn stepped back, and I saw distance in his eyes. 'You don't trust me,' he said quietly. 'You don't trust me to make my own choices. You think I'm too weak, too foolish to survive without you holding my hand.'"

"'That's not true!' I protested, but I felt the lie. I was gripping him too tightly, and I could feel him slipping away. 'Just listen to me. I know what's best for you.'"

"Renn shook his head. 'No, you don't. You know what's best for you, keeping me here, keeping me under your control. But that's not friendship. That's possession.'"

"He left that night. Not in anger, but in sadness. And I was left alone, gripping nothing but my own fear."


"'Hold this,' he said, pointing to glowing metal in the fire. 'Bring it to the anvil.'"

"I grabbed the tongs and clamped down hard, my knuckles white with tension. I pulled the metal from the fire, gripping so tightly my hands ached."

"'Strike it,' Master Kael commanded."

"I raised the hammer and brought it down. The metal bent, but not as it should. When I released it, I saw deep indentations where I had gripped too hard, marks that would weaken the steel, flaws that would make it break under pressure."

"Master Kael examined the piece. 'What do you see?'"

"'I gripped too tightly. I left marks.'"

"'Why?'"

"'I was afraid. Afraid of dropping it, of losing it, of failing.'"

"Master Kael nodded. 'And what happened when you gripped from fear?'"

"'I damaged what I was trying to hold.'"

"He took the tongs and selected another piece of metal. This time, he held it with a firm but gentle grip, strong enough to control it, loose enough to let it breathe. He worked it, and when he was done, the steel was perfect, unmarked, strong."

"'Control is not about gripping tightly,' he said. 'It is about knowing when to hold and when to release. If you grip too tightly, you leave marks that weaken what you hold. If you grip too loosely, the metal slips and shatters. The blacksmith must hold with calm firmness, not too much, not too little. This is balance, not domination.'"

"He set down the tongs and looked at me with knowing eyes. 'You are not holding steel, young one. You are holding a friendship. And you are gripping it so tightly that you are leaving marks. You are weakening what you are trying to protect.'"

"In that moment, I understood. I saw myself clearly, not as a protector, but as someone so afraid of loss that I was destroying what I loved. I had gripped Renn with fear, not with care. I had tried to control him, not to support him. I had left marks on our friendship. Master Kael's voice was gentle but firm. 'A true friend holds with strength, not force. He holds with care, not possession. He holds with firmness, not rigidity. And he knows when to let go, when to trust, when to allow the other to choose their own path. That is the grip of the blacksmith. That is the grip of a true friend.'"

The grandfather looked at his grandson, his eyes clear with the wisdom of years. "I wrote to Renn that day. I told him I was wrong, that I had been gripping too tightly out of fear, not out of love. I told him I trusted him to choose his own path, and that I would be here if he needed me, but I would not try to control him. Renn did go to the capital. He did join the royal guard. And he did come back, years later, stronger and wiser. Our friendship survived, but only because I learned to let go of my need to control it. I learned that gripping too tightly damages what you're trying to protect, but letting go completely creates chaos. The art is in finding the balance, knowing when to hold and when to release."

He set down his invisible tongs. "Young men often over-control out of fear: fear of abandonment, fear of being hurt, fear of being disrespected, fear of losing what little stability they have. So they cling, to relationships, to pride, to anger, to routines, to the illusion of power. But gripping too tightly bends the steel. It damages what it holds. Likewise, letting go completely leads to chaos. Learn the grip of the blacksmith, grandson. Hold what matters with strength, not force. Hold your relationships with care, not possession. Hold your boundaries with firmness, not rigidity. Hold your values with conviction, not fanaticism. And know when to let go, of grudges, of control, of the need to be right, of relationships that have run their course. The art is in knowing the difference between what needs to be held and what needs to be released."

**THE LESSON:** This parable teaches that **true control is balanced grip, not domination or abandonment**. The blacksmith's tongs represent the balance between gripping too tightly (leaving marks, weakening steel) and too loosely (metal slips, shatters). This addresses **anxiety** and **fear** (of abandonment, hurt, disrespect, instability) that drive over-control. Clinging to relationships, pride, anger, routines, or power damages what the warrior is trying to protect. But complete release creates chaos. The art is discernment: hold relationships with care, not possession; boundaries with firmness, not rigidity; values with conviction, not fanaticism. **Technique:** The warrior must examine his grip. He must ask: "Am I holding with strength or force? Am I caring or possessing? Am I firm or rigid?" He must learn when to hold and when to release, grudges, control, the need to be right. Balance is mastery.
