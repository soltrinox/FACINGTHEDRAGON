## **The Hunter Who Never Missed**

The grandfather's voice took on a tone of warning. "A man who cannot forgive himself becomes a perfectionist, and perfection is its own prison," he said.

The grandson shifted uncomfortably. "But isn't perfection the goal? Shouldn't we strive to be better, to never make mistakes?"

The old man's eyes narrowed slightly. "Better, yes. Perfect, no. There is a difference, and that difference is everything." He leaned forward, his weathered hands resting on his knees. "Let me tell you a story about when I learned this truth the hard way, grandson. When I was the hunter who never missed, and how that very skill became my undoing."

The grandson sat back, his expression skeptical. "You? A perfectionist? You always seem so... calm about things."

"Now, yes," the grandfather said. "But not always. Not when I was young. Not when I was your age." His voice grew distant, traveling back through the years. "I was twenty-two, maybe twenty-three. I had become the best archer in our village. Not by natural talent, I had none. But by obsession. By punishing myself for every mistake until I made none."

He closed his eyes, seeing the memory. "There was a man named Karo. He was older than me, had been hunting for twenty years. He was good, but not perfect. He missed sometimes. He laughed about it. He would say, 'The deer got away today, but tomorrow is another hunt.' I thought he was weak. I thought his acceptance of failure was a flaw."

The grandfather's hands mimed drawing a bow. "I trained every day, from dawn until I couldn't see the target anymore. If I missed, I would practice until my fingers bled. If my form was imperfect, I would stand in position for hours, muscles screaming. I believed that any mistake made me unworthy. That failure was a stain on my character that could only be removed by never failing again."

"Didn't that make you better?" the grandson asked.

"In some ways, yes," the grandfather admitted. "I became precise. I became consistent. But I also became rigid. I feared trying new techniques because I might fail. I avoided challenging targets because missing would prove I wasn't perfect. I refused help from others because accepting help meant admitting I wasn't already perfect. I mocked vulnerability in others because I couldn't allow it in myself. I dismissed rest because rest was for those who weren't committed to perfection."

He paused, his voice dropping. "One day, during the great hunt, the annual competition where all the villages gathered to test their best archers, I stood before the final target. It was a difficult shot: a small wooden disc, painted red, swinging from a branch fifty paces away. The wind was strong. The sun was in my eyes. But I had never missed. Not in practice. Not in competition. Not ever."

The grandson leaned forward, caught in the story.

"I drew my bow. I took aim. I felt the familiar confidence, the certainty that came from never having failed. But as I released the arrow, my hand trembled. Just once. Just a tiny tremor, so small I barely felt it. But it was enough."

"The arrow missed," the grandson said quietly.

"The arrow missed," the grandfather confirmed. "Not by much. It grazed the edge of the disc, close enough that some argued it should count. But I knew. I had missed. For the first time in years, I had failed."

"What happened?" the grandson asked.

"What happened was not the miss itself," the grandfather said, his voice heavy. "What happened was what I did to myself afterward. I couldn't forgive myself. I couldn't accept that I had made a mistake. I stood there, frozen, while others continued the competition. I felt as if my entire identity had been shattered. If I wasn't perfect, then who was I? If I could fail, then what was I worth?"

The old man's eyes opened, meeting his grandson's. "That night, I didn't sleep. I replayed the moment over and over. I analyzed every detail, searching for what I had done wrong, punishing myself for the imperfection. The next morning, I went to the practice range and shot arrow after arrow, trying to prove to myself that the miss was a fluke, that I was still perfect."

"Did you miss again?" the grandson asked.

"No," the grandfather said. "I didn't miss. But something else happened. Karo found me there, still shooting as the sun rose. He watched me for a long time, saying nothing. Finally, he spoke."

"'You're trying to prove something,' Karo said. 'But what? That you're perfect? You already know you're not. You missed yesterday. So what?'"

"'So what?' I snapped, my voice cracking with something that felt like desperation. 'So everything! I'm supposed to be the best. I'm supposed to never miss. If I can fail, then I'm nothing!'"

"Karo stepped closer. 'You think perfection is what makes you worthy? You think never missing is what makes you a hunter? Look at me, boy. I've missed thousands of shots. I've failed more times than you've even tried. Does that make me nothing?'"

"'You're different,' I said, but the words felt hollow."

"'How?' Karo asked. 'How am I different? Because I can forgive myself when I fail? Because I can learn from mistakes instead of being destroyed by them? Because I understand that being human means being imperfect?'"

"He picked up my bow, which I had dropped. 'This is a tool, boy. You are the hunter. The tool can be perfect. The arrow can fly true. But you? You are human. You will tremble. You will miss. You will fail. That is not a flaw, that is being alive.'"

"'But if I'm not perfect, then what am I?' I asked, and I heard the desperation in my own voice."

"Karo's expression softened. 'You are a hunter who missed a shot. That's all. One miss doesn't erase all the hits. One failure doesn't make you a failure. One mistake doesn't make you unworthy. The question is not whether you'll be perfect, you won't be. The question is whether you can forgive yourself when you're not, learn from it, and keep hunting anyway.'"

"He handed me back my bow. 'Mastery is not perfection, boy. Mastery is the ability to face imperfection with dignity. To fail and try again. To miss and keep aiming. To be human and still worthy. That is what makes a true hunter. Not never missing, but never giving up, even when you do.'"

The grandfather paused, letting the memory settle. "That was the moment I understood, grandson. Not immediately, it took time. But Karo's words planted a seed. I began to see that my perfectionism wasn't strength, it was a mask for shame. I believed that mistakes made me unworthy, so I had to be perfect to prove I was worthy. But that belief itself was the prison."

"How did you learn to forgive yourself?" the grandson asked.

"Slowly," the grandfather said. "Painfully. I had to practice it, like I had practiced archery. Every time I made a mistake, I had to consciously choose forgiveness over self-punishment. I had to ask myself: 'Can I be human and still worthy? Can I fail and still try again?'"

He reached out and touched his grandson's hand. "I learned that perfection is a mask for shame. Young men hide their wounds behind skill, achievement, dominance, or emotional silence. But mastery is not perfection. Mastery is the ability to face imperfection with dignity. Your dragon feeds on your self-judgment, grandson. Starve it by embracing your humanity."

The grandson looked down at his hands. "But what if I make a mistake that hurts someone? What if I fail at something important?"

"You will," the grandfather said gently. "You will make mistakes, grandson. You will fail, you will stumble, you will hurt people you care about, you will say the wrong thing, you will react poorly. This is not a character flaw, this is being human. The question is not whether you'll be imperfect, but whether you can forgive yourself when you are, learn from it, make amends where possible, and continue forward."

He squeezed his grandson's hand. "That is the path of mastery, not flawlessness, but the courage to be flawed and keep trying anyway. That is what I learned from Karo, and what I'm trying to teach you now. Perfection is a prison. Self-forgiveness is freedom."

**THE LESSON:** This parable teaches that **perfectionism is shame disguised as standards**. The hunter who never missed represents **shame** (believing mistakes make one unworthy), **all-or-nothing thinking** (perfection or failure, nothing between), and inability to forgive oneself. Perfection creates rigidity, fearing novelty, avoiding challenges, refusing help, mocking vulnerability, dismissing rest. One mistake destroys because self-forgiveness is absent. Perfection masks wounds behind achievement. But mastery is facing imperfection with dignity, not achieving flawlessness. **Technique:** When the warrior makes mistakes (and he will), he must practice self-forgiveness. He must ask: "Can I be human and still worthy? Can I fail and still try again?" The dragon feeds on self-judgment. He must starve it by embracing his humanity, learn, make amends, continue forward. Mastery is courage to be flawed, not elimination of flaws.
