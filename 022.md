## **The Three Rivers**

The grandfather traced three lines in the dirt, each flowing toward a central point. "Your mind, your heart, and your instincts must flow together, or you will drown in your own turbulence," he said. "There were once three rivers that ran through our lands: The River of Thought, The River of Feeling, The River of Action. When I was young, I believed action mattered most. Thought was too slow. Feeling was too painful. So I drank only from the River of Action."

He paused, his eyes distant with memory. "Let me tell you how I learned this lesson through a conflict that nearly destroyed everything I held dear."

* * *

"When I was twenty-three, there was a man named Kael who had been my friend since childhood. We trained together, fought together, trusted each other with our lives. But then came the dispute over the water rights to the eastern fields. My family's claim was older, but Kael's family had worked the land for three generations. The elders called for a meeting to settle it peacefully."

"I arrived with my hand already on my sword. I had decided before anyone spoke that action would prove my family's honor. When Kael stood to present his family's case, I cut him off mid-sentence."

*"Enough talk," I said, my voice sharp as a blade. "My family's claim is clear. We will not negotiate what is rightfully ours."*

*Kael looked at me with confusion, then hurt. "We are not enemies," he said. "We can find a solution that honors both our families. The elders have proposed, "*

*"I don't care what they propose," I interrupted. "Words are for cowards. If you want the water, you'll have to take it from me."*

*Kael's face hardened. "So be it," he said quietly. "If you will not listen, then we are done."*

"I stormed out, proud of my decisiveness. But that night, I learned that my family's claim was actually weaker than I thought. The elders had been prepared to grant us a fair share, but my refusal to listen had destroyed any chance of compromise. I had acted without thinking, without feeling, and I had lost a friend and damaged my family's standing."

The old man drew the first line deeper. "That was the River of Action, flowing alone. I leapt before seeing where I would land. I fought before asking why. When a man reacts only from action, he becomes a weapon, dangerous to everyone, including himself."

* * *

"Months passed. The conflict escalated. Kael's family took the water by force, and my family's crops began to wither. My father came to me, his face lined with worry. 'We need to act,' he said. 'But we must act wisely.'"

"This time, I tried a different approach. I would think through every possibility, analyze every angle. I spent days in my room, mapping out strategies, weighing options."

*"We cannot move until we know everything," I told my father. "We must consider every possibility, every outcome, every risk."*

*"The crops are dying now," my father said urgently. "We need to act."*

*"But what if we act too soon?" I countered. "What if we make it worse? What if we lose everything?"*

"Days became weeks. I saw every danger, considered every consequence, and became frozen by the weight of possibilities. My family's fields continued to wither while I sat paralyzed by analysis. My father finally came to me, his hands shaking with frustration."

*"Your thinking has become our enemy," he said. "You see so many dangers that you see none clearly. You are so afraid of making the wrong choice that you make no choice at all. A man stuck in thought cannot protect those he loves."*

The grandfather drew the second line. "That was the River of Thought, flowing alone. I had become overcautious, afraid to act, paralyzed by analysis. A man stuck in thought cannot protect those he loves."

* * *

"Finally, I could bear it no longer. The sight of my family's suffering, the loss of my friendship with Kael, the weight of my failures, it all crashed over me like a wave. I abandoned thought entirely and let pure emotion guide me."

*"I will make this right!" I shouted to no one, my voice raw with feeling. "I will show them all!"*

"I gathered my weapons and marched toward Kael's family's fields, driven by a storm of emotion. But as I walked, my feelings shifted. The rage gave way to despair. The determination crumbled into doubt. By the time I reached the fields, I was weeping with confusion, my emotions swinging wildly between fury and hopelessness."

*Kael found me there, standing in the middle of the irrigation channel, my sword in my hand but my will broken. He approached slowly, his own weapon sheathed.*

*"What are you doing?" he asked, his voice not angry, but sad.*

*"I don't know," I admitted. "I'm lost. I feel everything and nothing. I don't know what to do."*

*"A man led only by emotion becomes unpredictable," Kael said quietly. "You swing from rage to despair with no anchor. This is not strength. This is chaos."*

The grandfather drew the third line. "That was the River of Feeling, flowing alone. A man led only by emotion becomes unpredictable, overwhelmed, and vulnerable to his own storms."

* * *

"Kael sat beside me in that irrigation channel, and we talked for the first time in months. Not as enemies, but as men who had both been drowning in their own turbulence."

*"I was wrong to act without listening," I said, the words coming from genuine reflection. "I let action rule me, and I hurt you."*

*"And I was wrong to take the water by force," Kael replied. "I let my family's fear drive me, and I hurt you in return."*

*"I tried to think my way out of it," I continued, "but I became paralyzed by all the possibilities."*

*"And I tried to feel my way through it," Kael said, "but my emotions became a storm I couldn't navigate."*

"We sat there in silence, watching the water flow between our families' fields. And in that moment, I understood something fundamental."

*"What if," I said slowly, "we let our thoughts guide our feelings, and our feelings motivate our actions, and our actions teach our thoughts? What if the three rivers flow together instead of separately?"*

*Kael looked at me, and for the first time in months, I saw the friend I had known. "Show me," he said.*

The grandfather brought the three lines together at the center. "That day, I learned balance. I thought about what both our families truly needed, not just water, but respect, security, and peace. I felt the value of our friendship, the importance of honor, the weight of responsibility. And I acted from that integration: I proposed we share the water, rotate the irrigation, and work together to expand the channel so both families could thrive."

*"This is what I think we need," I told Kael, laying out the plan I had considered. "This is what I feel is right," I said, speaking from my heart about our friendship and our families' honor. "And this is what I will do," I concluded, committing to the action.*

"Kael agreed. We brought the proposal to the elders, and they accepted it. Our families flourished. Our friendship was restored, stronger than before. And I learned the lesson that saved me: The three rivers must meet within you. Thought to guide you. Feeling to connect you. Action to empower you."

The old man looked at his grandson with intensity. "The dragon you face feeds on imbalance. It grows strongest when one of your rivers overflows and submerges the others. Your task is not to eliminate your emotions. Your task is to unify them, to let your thoughts inform your feelings, your feelings motivate your actions, and your actions teach your thoughts. This is the integration that creates a whole man. This is how I learned it, through failure, through loss, through the hard wisdom that comes only when you have tried every wrong way and finally discover the right one."

**THE LESSON:** This parable teaches that **wholeness requires integrating thought, feeling, and action**. Living from one river alone creates imbalance: action alone makes one impulsive and reactive; thought alone paralyzes with **catastrophizing** (seeing every danger) and analysis; feeling alone overwhelms with **emotional reasoning** (being ruled by mood swings). The dragon feeds on imbalance, when one river floods, it submerges the others. Integration means letting thoughts guide feelings, feelings motivate actions, and actions inform thoughts. This creates a unified, whole person rather than fragmented parts fighting each other. **Technique:** When facing decisions, the warrior must check all three rivers: What do I think (analysis)? What do I feel (values, needs)? What will I do (action)? He must ensure all three inform each other. Balance creates mastery; imbalance creates chaos.
