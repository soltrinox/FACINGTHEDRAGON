## **The Two Wolves by the River**

The grandfather settled back, his voice taking on the cadence of ancient storytelling. "Let me tell you a story from my own youth," he began, his eyes distant with memory. "It was the summer I turned nineteen, and I thought I knew everything about strength. But I had not yet learned which voice to listen to when my pride was wounded."

He gestured with both hands, as if the wolves were present before them. "There are two wolves who walk beside every warrior, one on each side, constant companions throughout his life. One wolf burns with rage, suspicion, and hurt pride. The other carries patience, clarity, and wisdom. Both offer power. Both want to lead you into battle. But they whisper different truths."

The old man's voice rose slightly, mimicking the angry wolf: "The angry wolf shouts: 'Strike first so you cannot be hurt.'" Then his voice dropped to a whisper, embodying the wise wolf: "The wise wolf whispers: 'Stand tall so you do not fear being seen.'"

He leaned forward, his weathered hands resting on his knees. "I learned this lesson at the river, on a day that changed everything. There was a man named Kael, older than me by several years, who had a way of making others feel small. He was not cruel by nature, but he had learned that belittling others made him feel powerful. And I, in my youth, was the perfect target, proud, insecure, and quick to anger."

The grandfather's eyes closed briefly, as if reliving the moment. "It was market day, and I had just sold my first proper catch of fish. I felt proud, walking through the village with coins in my pocket. Then I saw Kael standing by the river with a group of others, and I made the mistake of walking too close."

His voice took on the cadence of memory. "Kael looked at me, then at the others, and laughed. 'Look at the boy,' he said, his voice carrying across the water. 'Thinks he's a fisherman now because he caught three minnows.' The others chuckled, and my face burned. The angry wolf inside me howled: *Make him pay. Show them all you're not weak.*"

The grandfather's hands clenched, then relaxed. "I could feel the rage building, that familiar heat in my chest. I wanted to strike him, to prove I was not someone to be mocked."

He continued, his voice now embodying the young man he once was: "'You know nothing about me,' I said, my voice tight with controlled anger. Kael stepped closer, his smile widening. 'I know enough. I know you're a boy playing at being a man. I know you'll never be more than what you are right now, small, insignificant, easily forgotten.'"

The grandfather's shoulders sagged. "And that was when I made my choice. The angry wolf won. I lunged at him, my fists flying, my mind consumed by the need to prove my worth through violence. We fought there by the river, rolling in the mud, trading blows while others watched. But when it was over, when we both stood panting and bloodied, I realized something terrible: I had proven nothing except that I was exactly what he said, reactive, controlled by my anger, feeding the wolf that made me smaller with every choice."

His voice grew quiet. "Kael wiped blood from his lip and looked at me, and for a moment, I saw something in his eyes I had not expected: not triumph, but recognition. 'You're just like me,' he said quietly, so only I could hear. 'You think fighting proves something. But all it proves is that you're afraid.' Then he walked away, and I was left standing there, my hands shaking, my pride in tatters, with nothing to show for my rage but bruises and the knowledge that I had become exactly what I feared."

The grandfather looked at his grandson with profound sadness. "That night, I sat by the same river, alone, and I understood something for the first time. Every time someone slighted me, I had thrown meat to the angry wolf. But the control was an illusion. The anger made me smaller, not larger."

His voice strengthened with hard-won wisdom. "The next day, I saw Kael again at the market. He saw me coming and tensed, expecting another fight. But I had made a different choice. I walked up to him and said: 'You were right about one thing yesterday. I was trying to prove something. But I realize now that what I need to prove, I prove to myself, not to you.'"

The grandfather's eyes brightened with the memory. "Kael stared at me, confused. 'What game are you playing?' he asked. 'No game,' I told him. 'I'm choosing not to feed the wolf that makes me smaller. I'm choosing to stand tall without needing to strike first.'"

He paused. "Kael's expression changed. The mockery faded, replaced by something that looked almost like respect. 'You're different today,' he said. 'What changed?' And I told him the truth: 'I learned that I have two wolves inside me. One wants me to destroy anything that threatens my pride. The other wants me to know my worth so deeply that threats cannot touch it. Yesterday, I fed the wrong wolf. Today, I'm choosing differently.'"

The grandfather leaned back, his story complete. "That was how I discovered the moral, grandson. Not through philosophy or teaching, but through the hard lesson of experience. I learned that when you do not know your worth, you destroy anything that threatens the illusion of it. But when you know your worth, truly know it, not as something granted by others but as something inherent, you protect what truly matters. You feed the wise wolf. You choose understanding over reaction, patience over vengeance."

He looked at his grandson with deep compassion. "Kael and I never became friends, but we learned to respect each other. More importantly, I learned to respect myself enough not to need his approval, or his fear, to know who I was. That is the lesson: one becomes what one consistently feeds. The wolf you feed grows stronger. Feed the angry wolf, and you become reactive, defensive, always fighting shadows. Feed the wise wolf, and you become someone who stands firm not because you're afraid of being seen, but because you're not afraid of being seen at all."

**THE LESSON:** This story teaches that **one becomes what one consistently feeds**. Two impulses exist within every warrior: reactive rage and reflective wisdom. Both offer power, but lead to different destinations. Feeding the angry wolf creates **self-fulfilling prophecy** (defensive reactions create the rejection one fears) and perpetuates **helplessness** (using violence to feel control). When self-worth is uncertain, the warrior attacks anything that threatens his fragile self-image. The wise wolf operates from secure worth, choosing response over reaction. **Technique:** Before acting on anger, the warrior must ask: "Which wolf am I feeding right now?" He must recognize that every choice either strengthens reactive patterns or builds conscious mastery. The wolf he feeds grows stronger. By choosing understanding over immediate reaction, he starves the dragon while nourishing the warrior within.
