## **The Spear with Two Points**

The grandfather sat back down, the fire crackling between them, and his voice took on a reflective quality. "A weapon forged without wisdom harms its wielder as often as its enemy," he said. "While you sit by my fire, grandson, let me tell you about a spear I once carved, and the lesson it taught me about myself."

He leaned forward, the flames casting shadows across his weathered face. "I was young then, perhaps your age, and I had a rival named Kael. He was older, stronger, and he never missed an opportunity to remind me of it. Every training session, every sparring match, he would find a way to mock my technique, to point out my weaknesses, to make me feel small. And I, in my pride, would respond with anger. I would challenge him, I would fight harder, I would let every insult become fuel for my rage."

The old man's eyes grew distant, seeing another time. "One day, after Kael had humiliated me in front of the other warriors, he had disarmed me with a simple feint and laughed as my blade clattered to the ground, I stormed away, my face burning with shame. That night, I sat in my workshop, consumed by my anger, and I had what I thought was a brilliant idea. I would create a weapon that would make me unbeatable. A spear with two sharpened ends, one to thrust forward at enemies, and one to counter attacks from behind. I believed myself clever, thinking I had created something unmatched."

He paused, shaking his head at the memory of his younger self's arrogance. "I worked through the night, carving and sharpening, my hands bleeding from the work, but I didn't care. I was driven by the need to prove myself, to show Kael that I was not to be underestimated. When dawn came, I held my creation in my hands, and I thought it was perfect. I could attack and defend simultaneously. No one could surprise me. No one could defeat me."

"The next morning, I marched into the training grounds, my double-ended spear in hand. Kael was there, as always, practicing with the other warriors. When he saw me, he stopped and stared at my weapon, his expression unreadable. 'What is that?' he asked, his voice flat."

"'A weapon you've never seen before,' I said, my voice tight with pride and anger. 'I challenge you to a match. This time, you won't find it so easy to disarm me.'"

"Kael studied the spear for a long moment, then looked at me with something that might have been pity. 'A weapon with two points,' he said slowly. 'Tell me, young warrior, have you tested it?'"

"'I don't need to test it,' I snapped. 'I know it will work. Are you afraid to face it?'"

"Kael's expression hardened. 'Very well,' he said. 'But know this: a weapon you cannot control is more dangerous to you than to your enemy.'"

"The other warriors gathered around us, forming a circle. I took my stance, gripping the spear in the middle, both ends gleaming in the morning light. Kael drew his single-bladed sword and waited. I lunged forward, thrusting with the front point, but Kael sidestepped easily. As he moved, I tried to pivot, to bring the rear point into play, but the weapon was unwieldy. To attack with one end, I had to compromise my grip. To defend with the other, I had to twist my body awkwardly."

"Kael didn't attack immediately. He circled me, watching, studying. 'You're off-balance,' he observed calmly. 'Your stance is compromised because you're trying to keep both ends ready.'"

"'I can handle it!' I shouted, thrusting again, this time with more force. But my attack was clumsy, and Kael deflected it with a simple parry. As he did, he stepped inside my guard, and I tried to bring the rear point around to strike him. But in my haste, I misjudged the distance, and the sharpened end of my own spear cut deep into my left arm."

"The pain was immediate and sharp. I cried out, dropping the spear, blood streaming down my arm. The other warriors gasped. Kael lowered his sword and stepped back, his expression now genuinely concerned."

"'You see?' he said quietly. 'The weapon you created to protect you has wounded you instead. You were so focused on having two points of attack that you forgot the most important rule of combat: control. A weapon you cannot master will turn against you.'"

"I stood there, bleeding, humiliated, the truth of his words cutting deeper than the wound in my arm. 'I thought...' I began, but my voice trailed off."

"'You thought having more weapons would make you stronger,' Kael finished. 'But strength isn't in the number of blades you carry. It's in knowing how to use the one you have. It's in knowing when to strike and when to hold back. It's in controlling your weapon, not letting your weapon control you.'"

"He sheathed his sword and approached me. 'Let me see that wound,' he said. I hesitated, still stinging from his words, but I extended my arm. He examined the cut, then tore a strip from his own tunic and bound it. 'This will heal,' he said. 'But the lesson you learn today will serve you far longer than any clever weapon.'"

"I looked at my double-ended spear lying on the ground, and for the first time, I saw it for what it was: not a tool of mastery, but a symbol of my own lack of control. I had created it in anger, driven by pride, and I had wielded it with the same reactive emotions that had led me to make it in the first place."

"'How did you know?' I asked Kael, my voice barely above a whisper."

"'Because I was once like you,' he said. 'I thought that being sharp, being reactive, being quick to anger made me powerful. But I learned that true strength comes from discipline. From knowing when to strike and when to hold your blade still. Your emotions are like that spear, they have two points. They can protect you or they can wound you. The difference is in how you wield them.'"

The grandfather looked up at his grandson, the firelight reflecting in his eyes. "That day, I learned something fundamental about myself. As a young man, my emotions were like that spear, sharp, reactive, unfocused. Every feeling became a point. Every insecurity became a blade. Every slight became a reason to thrust outward. I thought being sharp made me powerful. But the truth is this: Tools without mastery hurt their owner first. Emotions without understanding destroy their bearer most."

He paused, making sure his grandson understood. "Your anger, your defensiveness, your need for respect, they are all points of the spear. But unless you learn the discipline to wield them, you will cut yourself long before you cut any dragon. Strength is not in having a sharp weapon. Strength is in knowing when not to use it. The most dangerous warrior is not the one who strikes fastest or hardest, but the one who can hold his blade still when every instinct screams to attack. That is the mastery you must seek, not the elimination of your emotions, but the discipline to choose when and how to express them."

**THE LESSON:** This parable teaches that **unmastered emotional intensity harms oneself before harming others**. The double-ended spear represents reactive emotions, sharp, dangerous, and difficult to control. Every feeling becomes a weapon, every insecurity a blade. This reflects **anger** (reactive defensiveness), **anxiety** (constant threat-scanning), and lack of emotional discipline. Without mastery, the warrior cuts himself: compromising his stance, risking self-harm, creating danger through missteps. True strength isn't having sharp emotions, it's knowing when not to deploy them. **Technique:** Before reacting emotionally, the warrior must pause and assess: "Will using this emotion now help or harm me?" He must practice restraint, holding his blade still when instinct screams to attack. He must master his tools through discipline: choose when and how to express emotions rather than letting them control him. Mastery is choice, not elimination.
