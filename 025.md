## **The Seven Doors**

The grandfather drew seven doors in the dirt, labeling each one. "Every man has defenses, but only some lead to freedom," he said. "A fortress once had seven doors, each representing a way a young warrior defends himself: Anger, the fast door. Silence, the cold door. Withdrawal, the distant door. Humor, the deflecting door. Aggression, the intimidating door. Pride, the rigid door. Truth, the difficult door."

He looked up at his grandson. "Most young men use the first six. Few use the seventh. But the seventh is the only door that leads out of the fortress. The others merely rearrange the prison walls. You cannot defeat the dragon while hiding behind a door. Choose truth. It is the hardest door to open, and the only one that frees you."

The boy sat quietly, watching the lines in the dirt. "How did you learn this, Grandfather?"

The old man smiled, a distant look in his eyes. "I learned it the hard way, through my own foolishness. Let me tell you about a time when I was your age, when I thought I knew everything about defending myself."

He smoothed the dirt and began drawing again. "There was a boy named Kael, older than me, stronger, and he had a gift for finding the one thing that would cut deepest. We were both training to be warriors, and I was faster, more skilled with a blade. But Kael had something I didn't, he could read people, find their weaknesses, and he used that knowledge like a weapon."

"What did he do to you?" the grandson asked.

"He discovered that my father had left our family when I was young. I never spoke of it, but somehow Kael found out. One day, during training, in front of everyone, he said: 'You fight well, but it's no wonder. You've been running from your father's shadow your whole life. You're just like him, you'll abandon anyone when it gets hard.'"

The grandfather's voice grew quiet. "Those words cut deeper than any blade. I felt the heat rise in my chest, and I reached for the first door, Anger. I lunged at him, shouting: 'You know nothing about me! You're a liar and a coward!'"

"What happened?" the boy asked.

"Kael just smiled. 'See? You prove my point. You can't even control your temper. Just like your father, all rage, no discipline.' And he was right. My anger had given him exactly what he wanted. I had shown everyone that I was unstable, that I couldn't handle criticism. The anger felt good in the moment, but it solved nothing. It only made me look weak."

"So what did you do?"

"I tried the second door, Silence. For weeks, I said nothing to Kael. When he spoke, I ignored him. When he looked at me, I turned away. I thought my cold silence would punish him, show him that his words meant nothing to me."

"Did it work?"

The grandfather shook his head. "No. My silence built walls between us, but it also built walls between me and everyone else. I became isolated, distant. People stopped trying to talk to me because I was so cold. Kael noticed, and one day he said: 'Still running, I see. You can't even face me. You're hiding in your silence like a child.'"

"I tried the third door then, Withdrawal. I stopped training with the group. I practiced alone, ate alone, walked alone. I thought distance would protect me. But Kael found me anyway. 'You think hiding makes you strong?' he called out. 'It just proves you're too weak to stand among us.'"

The boy leaned forward. "What about humor? You said there was a door for that."

"Yes, the fourth door. I tried that too. When Kael would make his comments, I'd laugh them off. 'Oh, Kael, always so serious,' I'd say. 'You should try smiling sometime.' I deflected everything with jokes, made light of his attacks. But inside, every word still cut. And Kael saw through it. 'Your jokes don't fool anyone,' he said. 'You're just too scared to feel what you're really feeling.'"

"Then I tried the fifth door, Aggression. I started challenging Kael at every turn. I'd interrupt him, contradict him, try to intimidate him with my skill. I thought if I showed enough power, he'd back down. But aggression only created more enemies. Others saw me as a bully, and Kael's words gained more weight: 'See how he treats those who speak truth? He's exactly what I said, dangerous, unstable, just like his father.'"

"The sixth door was Pride. I built a wall of arrogance around myself. I told myself I was better than Kael, that his words didn't matter, that I was above such petty attacks. I walked with my head high, refused to acknowledge any weakness. But pride is rigid, unyielding. It prevented me from growing, from learning, from changing. And Kael saw that too: 'Your pride is your prison,' he said. 'You're so busy pretending to be strong that you'll never actually become strong.'"

The grandfather paused, looking at the seven doors drawn in the dirt. "I had tried all six doors, and each one had failed. Each one had trapped me deeper in the fortress of my defenses. I was exhausted, isolated, and more wounded than when I started. That's when I realized something: I wasn't trying to defeat Kael. I was trying to avoid the truth of what he was saying."

"What truth?" the grandson asked.

"That I was afraid. That I was running from my father's abandonment. That I was using my training, my skill, my anger, my silence, everything, to avoid feeling the pain of being left behind. Kael's words hurt because they were true, and I had been running from that truth my whole life."

"So what did you do?"

"I chose the seventh door, Truth. It was the hardest thing I'd ever done. I found Kael alone, and I said: 'You're right. I am afraid. I am running from my father's shadow. Every day I train, I'm trying to prove I'm not like him, but the fear that I am drives everything I do. Your words hurt because they're true, and I've been too scared to face that truth.'"

The grandfather's eyes grew distant. "Kael looked at me, and for the first time, his expression softened. 'I know,' he said. 'My father left too. I recognized the same fear in you that I had in myself. I was trying to force you to face it because I wished someone had done the same for me.'"

"They became friends after that?"

"Not immediately. But something changed. By speaking the truth, I had broken free from the fortress. I was no longer trapped by my defenses. The truth was difficult, vulnerable, risky, but it was the only door that actually led somewhere. It resolved the problem. It allowed me to see Kael as a person, not an enemy. It allowed me to face my own fear instead of running from it."

The grandfather looked at his grandson. "That's how I learned about the seven doors. Through failure. Through trying every wrong way first. I discovered that the first six doors, anger, silence, withdrawal, humor, aggression, pride, they all feel safer in the moment. They're familiar, comfortable. But they're traps. They rearrange the prison walls but never let you escape. Only truth, the difficult door, the vulnerable door, actually leads you out into the open air of authentic living."

He pointed to each door in turn. "When someone hurts you, you can respond with anger, quick, satisfying, but it solves nothing. You can respond with silence, cold, punishing, but it builds walls. You can withdraw, safe, distant, but it isolates you. You can deflect with humor, easy, comfortable, but it avoids the real issue. You can respond with aggression, powerful, intimidating, but it creates enemies. You can respond with pride, rigid, unyielding, but it prevents growth. Or you can respond with truth, difficult, vulnerable, but it actually resolves the problem and deepens connection. The first six doors keep you trapped in the fortress of your defenses. Only truth leads you out."

The boy studied the doors in the dirt. "How do you know which door you're choosing?"

"You feel it," the grandfather said. "When you reach for anger, silence, withdrawal, humor, aggression, or pride, you feel the walls closing in. You feel trapped, even if you feel safe. When you choose truth, you feel the fear, the vulnerability, but you also feel the space opening around you. You feel free, even if you feel exposed. That's how you know. Choose freedom over familiar traps."

**THE LESSON:** This parable teaches that **most defenses trap one; only truth frees**. The seven doors represent defensive responses: **anger** (fast, solves nothing), silence (cold, builds walls), withdrawal (isolates), humor (deflects, avoids), aggression (creates enemies), pride (prevents growth), truth (difficult but freeing). The first six rearrange prison walls, they're survival strategies that keep the warrior trapped in his fortress. Only truth leads out. This involves **survival mode thinking** (using familiar defenses) and **fear** (of vulnerability truth requires). **Technique:** When hurt, the warrior must notice which door he reaches for. He must ask: "Am I choosing comfort or freedom? Am I rearranging walls or opening the exit?" Truth is hardest, it requires vulnerability, honesty, risk, but it's the only door that actually resolves problems and deepens connection. Choose freedom over familiar traps.
