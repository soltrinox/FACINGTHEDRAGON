## **The Lamp with No Oil**

The grandfather held his hands cupped together as if cradling a flame. "You cannot be a light to others if you are burning yourself to ash," he said. His grandson watched the old man's weathered hands, the way they trembled slightly as they held the invisible light.

"When I was young, I wanted to be dependable, to be the warrior everyone called upon. I carried burdens that were not mine. I solved problems that were not my responsibility. I fought battles that belonged to others. In time, I grew resentful. Exhausted. Hollow."

He opened his hands, letting the imaginary flame dissipate. "But let me tell you the story of how I learned this, for it was not wisdom I was born with. It was a lesson that nearly destroyed me before I understood it."

The old man settled back, his eyes looking into a past only he could see. "I was twenty-three, and I had just returned from my first campaign. My name was known in three villages. When people needed help, they came to me. I never refused. Not once. I believed that a true warrior never said no, never showed weakness, never admitted he was tired."

"There was a man named Kaelen, an elder from the northern village. He had lost his son in the same campaign I'd fought in, and grief had made him bitter. He came to me one evening, his face lined with sorrow and expectation. 'You were there when my boy fell,' he said. 'You owe it to his memory to help me rebuild my home. The winter storms destroyed half of it, and I am too old to do the work alone.'"

"I had just returned from helping another family repair their roof. My hands were blistered, my back ached, and I had not slept properly in three days. But I looked at Kaelen's face, at the pain there, and I said yes. Of course I said yes. How could I refuse a grieving father?"

The grandfather's voice took on the cadence of memory. "So I went to his village the next morning. I worked from dawn until dusk, hauling stones, cutting timber, raising walls. Kaelen watched me work, occasionally pointing out what needed to be done, but he did not lift a tool. I told myself this was fine, he was old, he was grieving. I was strong, I could do this."

"On the third day, as I was struggling to lift a heavy beam into place, Kaelen approached me. 'You're moving slowly today,' he said. 'My son would have finished this by now. He was stronger than you, faster. But I suppose you'll have to do.'"

The old man's hands clenched. "Those words cut deeper than any blade. I had been giving everything I had, working until my muscles screamed, sleeping on the hard ground, eating only what I could scavenge. And he was comparing me unfavorably to his dead son. But instead of speaking my truth, I pushed harder. I worked faster. I lifted heavier loads. I would prove myself worthy."

"By the fifth day, I was a shell. My hands bled through my bandages. My vision blurred from exhaustion. I had not eaten a proper meal in a week. But Kaelen came to me with another request. 'The neighbor's fence needs repair,' he said. 'And old Marta's well has collapsed. You should help them too. A warrior serves his people, does he not?'"

"I remember standing there, covered in dirt and sweat, my body shaking with fatigue, and I said yes. Yes, of course. I would help them all. Because that's what warriors do. That's what strong men do. They never say no."

The grandfather's voice grew quiet. "But something broke in me that day. As I walked to the neighbor's house, I found myself resenting Kaelen. Resenting old Marta. Resenting everyone who asked for my help. I was angry, but I didn't understand why. I had chosen to help them. No one had forced me. So why did I feel so bitter?"

"It was on the seventh day that I learned the truth. I was repairing Marta's well, and I was so exhausted that I misjudged a step. I fell, and the stone I was carrying came down on my leg. The pain was excruciating. I couldn't stand. I couldn't work. I had to be carried back to the village."

"Kaelen came to see me as I lay in the healer's tent. 'This is disappointing,' he said, his voice cold. 'You promised to finish the work. A warrior keeps his word. My son would have finished, even injured. He would have found a way.'"

The old man paused, and his grandson saw pain flicker across his face. "That was the moment I understood. I had been trying to light Kaelen's path, to light everyone's path, with a lamp that had no oil. I had given until there was nothing left, and then I had resented them for taking what I had freely offered. But the truth was, I had never filled my own lamp. I had never tended to my own needs. I had believed that admitting I was tired, that I needed rest, that I had limits, would make me less of a man. Less of a warrior."

"The healer, an old woman named Sera, sat with me that night. She saw the anger in my eyes, the resentment. 'You're burning yourself to ash, young warrior,' she said. 'And for what? To prove you're strong? To earn approval from a man who will never give it? You cannot illuminate others' paths if you have no light left to give.'"

"I argued with her. 'But a warrior serves. A warrior helps. A warrior never says no.'"

"'A warrior also knows when to rest,' she replied firmly. 'A warrior knows when to sharpen his blade, when to repair his shield, when to tend his wounds. You have been fighting with a broken sword and calling it strength. That is not strength, boy. That is pride masquerading as virtue.'"

The grandfather looked at his grandson. "It took me weeks to heal from that injury. Weeks of lying still, of being forced to rest, of having nothing to give. And in that stillness, I finally understood. Kaelen was not my enemy. The people asking for help were not my enemies. My enemy was my own belief that I had to be everything to everyone, that I had to never show weakness, that I had to burn myself completely to prove my worth."

"When I was finally able to walk again, I went back to Kaelen's village. But this time, I went with boundaries. I told him I could help for three days, and then I needed to return home to tend to my own needs. He tried to guilt me, to shame me, to compare me to his son again. But for the first time, I held my ground. 'I am not your son,' I said. 'And I cannot be everything you need. I can help, but I must also help myself.'"

The old man's voice grew firm. "That was the day I learned that self-care is not selfishness. Self-care is maintenance of the warrior. A sword must be sharpened, a shield must be repaired, a body must rest, a mind must find peace, a heart must be nourished. When you're empty, you have nothing to give. When you're exhausted, you make poor decisions. When you're resentful, you hurt the people you're trying to help."

He touched his grandson's shoulder. "Young men often feel obligated to be strong for everyone. To never show fatigue. To never admit weakness. To never say 'I cannot carry more.' They believe that admitting their limits means they've failed as men. But a man who neglects his own needs becomes a danger, to himself and to others."

"Before you face the dragon, fill your lamp. No man fights well on an empty flame. And no man can help others heal if he refuses to tend his own wounds. The question you must ask yourself is not 'How much can I give?' but 'Am I giving from fullness or emptiness?' One cannot illuminate others while burning oneself to ash."

**THE LESSON:** This parable teaches that **self-neglect leads to burnout and resentment, not nobility**. The empty lamp represents giving from depletion rather than abundance. This reflects **people-pleasing** (sacrificing one's needs to earn love), **resentment** (giving more than one receives), and the false belief that admitting limits equals failure. When a warrior burns himself, health, sanity, peace, to light others' paths, he eventually resents them for taking what he freely offered. Empty, he makes poor decisions and hurts those he's trying to help. Self-care isn't selfish; it's warrior maintenance. **Technique:** The warrior must recognize his limits and honor them. He must say "I cannot carry more" without shame. He must fill his own lamp first: rest, nourish himself, tend his wounds. He must ask: "Am I giving from fullness or emptiness?" One can't illuminate others while burning oneself to ash.
