## **The Man Who Broke the Cycle with His Children**

The grandfather had been watching his grandson play with a younger child from the village, and he noticed how the boy was patient, kind, gentle. But he also noticed how sometimes, when the younger child misbehaved, the grandson's face would harden, his voice would sharpen, and he would become the very thing he had once been hurt by.

"Grandson," the old man said when the boy returned to the fire, "I saw you with the young one. You were kind, but I also saw something else. I saw the shadow of the cycle. Let me tell you about the day I realized I was becoming the very thing I had sworn I would never be, and how I learned to break the cycle."

The grandson sat down, his expression troubled. "What cycle, grandfather?"

"The cycle of hurt," the grandfather said. "The cycle where the wounded become the wounders, where the hurt become the hurters, where the patterns of pain are passed down, generation to generation, like a curse that cannot be broken."

He leaned forward, and his voice took on the weight of memory. "I was thirty-five, and I had two sons. The older one was ten, the younger one was seven. And I loved them, I truly did. But I did not know how to love them. I only knew how to be what my father had been: hard, silent, distant, demanding."

"One day, my older son came to me, his face bright with excitement. 'Father,' he said, 'I finished the carving you asked me to make. Look!' And he held up a small wooden figure, crudely made, imperfect, but clearly made with care and effort."

"And I looked at it, and I saw the flaws. I saw where the cuts were uneven, where the proportions were wrong, where the details were missing. And instead of seeing the effort, the care, the love that had gone into it, I saw only the imperfections."

"'This is not good enough,' I said. 'The cuts are uneven. The proportions are wrong. You need to do it again, and this time, do it right.'"

The grandfather's voice broke. "I will never forget the look on my son's face. The light in his eyes died. The excitement faded. And he said, quietly: 'I tried, Father. I tried my best.'"

"'Your best is not good enough,' I said. 'You need to do better.'"

"And he took the carving and walked away, his shoulders slumped, his head down. And I stood there, and I realized: I had become my father. I had become the man who could not see effort, only imperfection. I had become the man who could not see love, only failure. I had become the man who had hurt me, and I was now hurting my own children."

"That night, I could not sleep. I lay awake, thinking about my son's face, about the light dying in his eyes, about how I had become the very thing I had sworn I would never be. And I realized: I was passing the curse to another generation. I was becoming the ghost that would haunt my own children, just as my father's ghost had haunted me."


"'I'm sorry,' I said. 'I was wrong. I saw only the flaws, not the effort. I saw only the imperfections, not the care. I saw only what was wrong, not what was right. And I hurt you, and I am sorry.'"

"My son looked at me, his eyes wide with surprise. 'You're apologizing?' he asked."

"'Yes,' I said. 'Because I was wrong. And because I realize now that I was becoming my father, and I do not want to be my father. I do not want to hurt you the way he hurt me. I want to be different. I want to break the cycle.'"

The grandfather's voice grew quiet. "And that was the beginning. That was the moment I started to change. Not perfectly, not immediately, but I started to change. I started to see my children differently. I started to see their effort, their care, their love, not just their imperfections."

"I learned to praise before I criticized. I learned to see what was right before I saw what was wrong. I learned to value effort over perfection. I learned to be present, to be kind, to be patient. I learned to be the father I had never had, not by rejecting my father, but by choosing to be different."

"But it was hard. Every day, I had to fight against the patterns I had learned. Every day, I had to choose to be different. Every day, I had to remind myself: 'I will not become my father. I will not pass the curse. I will break the cycle.'"

"And slowly, I began to change. I began to see my children's faces light up when I praised them. I began to see them come to me with their problems, their joys, their fears. I began to see them trust me, love me, connect with me. And I realized: I was breaking the cycle. I was stopping the curse. I was becoming the father I had never had, and in doing so, I was giving my children what I had never received."

The grandfather looked at his grandson, his eyes clear and direct. "The cycle of hurt can be broken. The curse can be stopped. The patterns can be changed. But it requires awareness, intention, and daily choice. It requires seeing the patterns, recognizing when you're repeating them, and choosing to be different."

"You will be tempted to become what hurt you. You will be tempted to pass the curse. You will be tempted to repeat the patterns. But you can choose differently. You can choose to break the cycle. You can choose to stop the curse. You can choose to be the father, the mentor, the man you never had, and in doing so, you can give to others what you never received."

He leaned forward. "When you see yourself becoming what hurt you, stop. When you see yourself repeating the patterns, pause. When you see yourself passing the curse, choose differently. Break the cycle. Stop the curse. Be the man you choose to be, not the man you were made to be."

"The cycle can be broken, grandson. The curse can be stopped. The patterns can be changed. But it starts with you. It starts with awareness. It starts with choice. It starts with the decision to be different, to be better, to break the cycle."

The grandson was quiet for a long time. "But what if I fail? What if I become what hurt me?"

"Then you try again," the grandfather said. "Breaking the cycle is not about perfection, it is about intention. It is about awareness. It is about choosing, again and again, to be different. You will fail sometimes. You will repeat the patterns sometimes. But if you are aware, if you are intentional, if you keep choosing to be different, you will break the cycle."

"Start with awareness," he continued. "Notice when you're becoming what hurt you. Notice when you're repeating the patterns. Notice when you're passing the curse. This awareness is the first step to change."

"Then choose differently. When you see yourself becoming what hurt you, choose to be different. When you see yourself repeating the patterns, choose to break them. When you see yourself passing the curse, choose to stop it."

"And then practice. Practice being different. Practice breaking the cycle. Practice stopping the curse. Every day, every moment, every choice. Practice until it becomes natural, until it becomes who you are, until the cycle is broken and the curse is stopped."

The grandfather's voice grew firm. "The cycle can be broken, grandson. The curse can be stopped. The patterns can be changed. But it starts with you. Break the cycle. Stop the curse. Be the man you choose to be. Give to others what you never received. This is how you heal, not just yourself, but the generations that come after you."

**THE LESSON:** This parable teaches that **the cycle of hurt can be broken**. The wounded can choose not to become the wounders. The patterns can be changed through awareness, intention, and daily choice. The warrior must see when he's becoming what hurt him, recognize when he's repeating patterns, and choose to be different. Breaking the cycle is not about perfection, it is about intention and awareness. **Technique:** The warrior must start with awareness, noticing when he's becoming what hurt him, repeating patterns, or passing the curse. Then he must choose differently, breaking the patterns and stopping the curse. Finally, he must practice, choosing again and again to be different until it becomes natural. The cycle can be broken, the curse can be stopped, but it starts with the warrior's choice to be different, to be better, to break the cycle for the generations that come after.
