## **The Test of the Six Mirrors**

The grandfather's voice took on a ceremonial quality. "The world shows you who you are, if you are brave enough to look," he said. "There is a rite of passage among our people known as the Test of the Six Mirrors. A young warrior enters a sacred chamber where six polished stones reflect different aspects of himself. One mirror shows your physical form. One shows your emotions. One shows your fears. One shows your pride. One shows your potential. One shows your true self."

He leaned back, his eyes distant, as if seeing through time. "When I was your age, I stood before the chamber door, trembling. Not from fear of what I would see, but from fear of what I wouldn't. The guardian of the mirrors was an old woman named Kira, who had watched hundreds of young men enter and leave unchanged. She looked at me with eyes that saw everything I tried to hide."

The grandfather's voice shifted, becoming younger, more defensive, as he recreated the scene. "'I'm ready,' I told her, my voice too loud, too certain. 'I know who I am. I know my weaknesses. I'm not afraid to face them.'"

"'Is that so?' Kira's voice was like stone scraping stone. 'Then why are your hands shaking? Why do you look at the door as if it leads to your execution?'"

"'I'm not afraid of weakness,' I insisted, my pride stung. 'I've faced my failures. I know I'm not strong enough, not good enough. I've accepted that.'"

"Kira's laugh was sharp, cutting. 'Accepted? Or hidden behind? There's a difference, boy. The first five mirrors will show you what you already know. The sixth will show you what you refuse to see. That's what you're truly afraid of.'"

"'I'm not afraid of anything,' I lied, my voice cracking."

"'Then enter,' she said, stepping aside. 'And when you reach the sixth mirror, remember this: the thing that terrifies you most is not your inadequacy. It's your adequacy. It's the man you could become if you stopped making excuses for staying small.'"

The grandfather paused, his eyes returning to the present. "I entered the chamber. The first mirror showed my body, strong, yes, but marked with scars from battles I'd lost. I could look at that. I'd seen my failures in every reflection. The second mirror showed my emotions, rage, shame, fear, all swirling like a storm. I could face that too. I knew I was broken. The third mirror showed my fears, abandonment, humiliation, being seen as weak. I'd lived with those. The fourth mirror showed my pride, the armor I wore to hide my wounds. I recognized that mask. The fifth mirror showed my potential, the warrior I could become, skilled, respected, whole. I stared at that one for a long time, feeling something strange: not hope, but dread."

He leaned forward, his voice dropping. "Then I came to the sixth mirror. It was larger than the others, darker, as if it absorbed light. I approached it slowly, my heart hammering. I told myself I was ready. I told myself I could face anything. But when I looked into it, I saw... nothing at first. Just darkness. Then, slowly, an image formed. A man. Strong, yes, but that wasn't what struck me. It was his eyes. They held no excuses. No blame. No victim story. They held only responsibility. And I realized, this was me. Not the me I was, but the me I could be if I stopped hiding behind my wounds, if I stopped using my past as an excuse, if I stopped pretending I was powerless."

The grandfather's hands clenched. "I stumbled back, my breath catching. I couldn't look. I turned away, my whole body shaking. Not from fear of weakness, I'd already accepted that. But from fear of strength. From fear of what it would mean to actually become that man. The responsibility. The change required. The excuses I'd have to abandon. The comfortable story I'd have to release, the story that said I was broken, that said I couldn't help it, that said my wounds made me who I was and I couldn't change."

He paused, his voice heavy with memory. "I left the chamber without completing the test. Kira was waiting outside. She didn't look surprised."

"'You couldn't face it, could you?' she said, not as an accusation, but as a statement of fact."

"'It showed me someone I'm not,' I said, my voice defensive. 'Someone I can never be. It was a lie.'"

"'Was it?' Kira's eyes bored into me. 'Or was it the truth you're too afraid to claim? Tell me, boy: what frightened you more, seeing your weakness, or seeing your strength? Seeing that you're broken, or seeing that you could be whole? Seeing that you're a victim, or seeing that you've been choosing to stay one?'"

"I stood there, my mouth open, no words coming. Because she was right. The first five mirrors showed me what I already knew, that I was wounded, that I was afraid, that I was prideful, that I had potential I wasn't using. But the sixth mirror... it showed me something worse. It showed me that the warrior capable of healing, of changing, of becoming whole, had been inside me all along. It showed me that I had no one to blame but myself for staying small. That I was choosing my limitations. That I was hiding behind my wounds because it was easier than facing the responsibility of healing them."

The grandfather's voice became urgent, his eyes locking with his grandson's. "That's when I learned the truth, grandson. I learned it not from the mirror itself, but from my reaction to it. My terror wasn't about inadequacy, I'd already accepted that. My terror was about adequacy. About the fact that I could be more, that I had always been able to be more, and that I was the only one stopping myself. The dragon of wounded pride thrives on that fear. It knows that if you looked into the sixth mirror, you would see that the warrior capable of slaying it has been inside you all along. You're not afraid of your weakness, grandson. You're afraid of your strength, of what it would mean to actually become the man you could be, of the responsibility that would bring, of the excuses you'd have to abandon, of the comfortable victim story you'd have to release."

He leaned back, his voice softening. "I went back the next day. I forced myself to look into the sixth mirror. I forced myself to see the man I could become. And I realized: potential isn't a gift. It's a responsibility. It demands change. It demands letting go of excuses. It demands accepting that you have no one to blame but yourself for staying small. Most men fear facing who they truly are. They prefer the comfort of familiar limitations. But that comfort is a prison. The sixth mirror shows you the key. The question is: are you brave enough to use it?"

**THE LESSON:** This parable teaches that **one fears one's potential more than one's weakness**. The six mirrors show different aspects: physical form, emotions, fears, pride, potential, true self. Most can look at five mirrors but not the sixth, not because it shows weakness, but because it shows who the warrior could become if he stopped hiding. This involves **fear** (of responsibility), **victim mentality** (comfortable excuses for staying small), and **shame** (believing he doesn't deserve to be that person). Potential demands change, responsibility, releasing excuses. The dragon thrives on this fear because the sixth mirror reveals the warrior capable of slaying it has always been inside him. **Technique:** The warrior must look into the sixth mirror. He must ask: "Who could I become if I stopped hiding? What am I afraid of, my weakness or my strength?" He must face his potential. The terror isn't inadequacy; it's adequacy and the responsibility it brings.
