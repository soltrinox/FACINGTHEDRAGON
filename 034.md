## **The Masterless Horse**

The grandfather's voice took on the quality of a storyteller, painting images in the air with his words. "A wild force without guidance destroys both the rider and the road," he said. "There was once a horse born of powerful lineage, fast, fierce, and strong. But it had no rider. No trainer. No direction. The horse ran endlessly across the plains, crashing through crops, shattering fences, trampling gardens. People feared it. And the horse grew to fear people."

He paused, letting the image settle. "But let me tell you a story about when I was that horse, grandson. When I learned this truth not from a parable, but from the wreckage I left behind."

The grandson shifted, leaning forward. The grandfather's eyes grew distant, traveling back through decades.

"I was nineteen, maybe twenty. Strong as an ox, quick with my fists, and burning with something I couldn't name. Anger, maybe. Pride. A need to prove I mattered. I worked at the mill with a man named Tomas, older, quieter, slower. He had been there fifteen years, knew every gear, every rhythm of the machines. I had been there three months and thought I knew everything."

The grandfather's hands moved as he spoke, shaping the memory. "One afternoon, Tomas was teaching me to adjust the main drive belt. 'Slowly,' he kept saying. 'Feel the tension. Too tight, and it snaps. Too loose, and nothing turns.' But I was impatient. I wanted to show him I could do it faster, better. I yanked the lever hard, forcing the belt tighter than it should go."

"'Stop!' Tomas shouted, but it was too late. The belt snapped with a crack like thunder. The whole mill ground to a halt. Workers stared. The foreman came running, his face red with fury."

"'What happened?' the foreman demanded."

"'The boy forced it,' Tomas said quietly. 'I told him to go slow, but he wouldn't listen.'"

"'I was trying to help!' I snapped back, my face hot. 'You're too slow, too careful. I can do this better than you.'"

"Tomas looked at me then, and there was no anger in his eyes. Only sadness. 'Better?' he said. 'You broke the belt. The mill stops. Twenty men cannot work. The grain spoils. Is that better?'"

"'I'm stronger than you!' I shouted, my voice cracking with something that felt like desperation. 'I can lift more, move faster, work harder. Why should I listen to someone weaker?'"

"Tomas stepped closer. The other workers had gathered around us now, a circle of witnesses. 'You think strength is about muscles?' he asked. 'You think power is about speed? Look around you, boy. Look at what your strength just did.'"

"He gestured at the silent machines, the idle workers, the broken belt hanging limp. 'Your strength without direction broke something that took years to build. My weakness, as you call it, kept this place running for fifteen years. Which one of us is truly strong?'"

"I wanted to hit him. I wanted to prove my point with my fists, because that was all I knew how to do. But something in his voice stopped me. Not fear, I wasn't afraid of him. It was something else. Recognition, maybe. That he was speaking a truth I had been running from."

"'You have power, yes,' Tomas continued, his voice softer now. 'But power without purpose is just destruction. You're like a wild horse, fast, fierce, strong. But you have no rider. No direction. You run and you break things, and then you wonder why people fear you. Why you fear yourself.'"

"'I don't fear myself,' I said, but the words sounded hollow even to me."

"'Then why are you always fighting?' Tomas asked. 'Why do you break things when you mean to fix them? Why do you hurt people when you want to help? You're not evil, boy. You're just... masterless. No one taught you what to do with your strength, so you use it on everything, and everything breaks.'"

"The foreman stepped forward. 'Tomas, I'll handle this. The boy needs to pay for the belt, and, '"

"'Wait,' Tomas interrupted. He looked at me, really looked at me, and I saw something I had never seen before: someone seeing past my anger, past my fists, past my need to prove myself. Seeing the lost boy underneath."

"'Come back tomorrow,' Tomas said. 'I'll teach you properly. Not just how to work the mill, but how to work with your strength instead of against it.'"

"'Why?' I asked, suspicious. 'Why would you help me after what I just did?'"

"'Because someone should have helped you long ago,' Tomas said. 'And because a horse without a rider eventually breaks its own legs. I don't want to see that happen to you.'"

"That night, I couldn't sleep. I kept seeing Tomas's face, hearing his words. *Power without purpose is just destruction. You're masterless. No one taught you what to do with your strength.*"

"The next morning, I went back. Not because I wanted to, but because something in me recognized the truth. Tomas was waiting. He didn't mention the incident. He just said, 'Today, we start over. Today, you learn to be a rider, not just a horse.'"

"For weeks, he taught me. Not just the mill work, but something deeper. How to channel my intensity. How to use my strength to build instead of break. How to listen before acting. How to measure twice and cut once, not just in wood, but in life."

"One day, months later, a new worker came in, young, angry, full of the same fire I had carried. He started pushing people around, breaking things, showing off his strength. I watched him, and I saw myself. I started to step forward, to stop him, but Tomas put a hand on my shoulder."

"'Let me,' he said. And he walked over to the young man, spoke quietly to him. I couldn't hear the words, but I saw the same transformation begin. The same recognition. The same slow understanding."

"Later, I asked Tomas, 'How did you know what to say to him? How did you know what to say to me?'"

"Tomas smiled. 'Because I was once the masterless horse too. Someone taught me to be a rider. Now I teach others. That's how wisdom works, boy. It's not something you keep. It's something you pass on.'"

"That was the moment I truly understood. The lesson wasn't just about the mill, or about strength, or about being careful. It was about this: *Strength without direction becomes destruction. Strength with direction becomes destiny.* I had been destroying because I didn't know how to build. I had been running wild because no one had taught me how to run with purpose."

The grandfather looked at his grandson, his eyes returning to the present. "That's how I learned it, grandson. Not from a book, not from a wise saying, but from breaking something important and having someone show me why. From being the masterless horse and learning, slowly and painfully, how to become a rider."

"Your dragon is powerful, yes. But so are you, if you learn how to channel your force with wisdom. The question is not whether you have power, but what you will do with it. Will you let it run wild, destroying everything in its path? Or will you master it, direct it, use it to build rather than to break? That choice is yours, grandson. That choice has always been yours."

**THE LESSON:** This parable teaches that **raw power without guidance becomes destructive force**. The masterless horse represents untrained emotional intensity, strength, passion, anger without direction or purpose. This reflects **helplessness** (no one taught the warrior what to do with his power) and **survival mode thinking** (using strength reactively rather than purposefully). The horse crashes through crops, shatters fences, tramples gardens, destroying rather than building. People fear it; it fears people. Strength without direction is dangerous; strength with direction becomes destiny. **Technique:** The warrior must identify his raw power (anger, passion, intensity) and ask: "What am I doing with this strength? Am I destroying or building? Do I have direction or am I running wild?" He must seek guidance, purpose, and emotional training. He must channel force toward meaningful goals rather than reactive destruction. The choice is his.
