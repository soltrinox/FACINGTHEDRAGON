## **The Lion Who Feared His Roar**

The grandfather's voice dropped to a whisper, then rose to demonstrate his point. "Power without control terrifies the powerful most of all," he said. He leaned forward, his weathered hands resting on his knees. "I learned this the hard way, when I was not much older than you are now. Let me tell you about the day I discovered what it means to have a roar, and why I was so afraid of it."

The old man's eyes grew distant, seeing something far away in time. "There was a boy in our village named Kael. He was older, bigger, and he had a way of making others feel small. Not through his fists, though he had those too. Through his words. He could find the exact thing that made you doubt yourself, and he would press on it like a bruise, day after day."

The grandson shifted, recognizing something familiar in the description. "What did he say to you?"

"He said many things," the grandfather replied quietly. "But what stuck was this: he told me I was dangerous. That I had a temper that would one day hurt someone I loved. That my intensity was a flaw, not a strength. And I believed him. Because I had seen my father's rage, how it could shatter things, how it could make my mother shrink into herself. I was terrified that the same fire burned in me."

The old man paused, gathering the memory. "So I did what seemed right: I tried to extinguish it. I became quiet, careful, always holding back. When Kael would taunt me, I would walk away. When he would push me, I would step back. I thought I was being strong by not reacting. But inside, the fire was still burning, and the more I tried to smother it, the hotter it got."

"One afternoon, Kael cornered my younger sister by the river. She was small, maybe eight years old, and she had done nothing wrong. But Kael had decided she was an easy target. I came around the bend and saw him standing over her, his voice sharp and cruel, making her cry."


The old man's shoulders slumped. "That was the moment I understood what Kael had been telling me all along. I was dangerous. My power was monstrous. I had become exactly what I feared."

"What happened then?" the grandson asked softly.

"I ran," the grandfather said. "I ran into the woods and I didn't come back until dark. I found an old man there, a hermit who lived in a cave near the river. He saw me sitting there, shaking, and he asked me what had happened. I told him everything, about Kael, about my rage, about how I had hurt someone and terrified my sister."

The hermit listened, then he told me a story. "There was once a lion who refused to roar," he said. "He feared the sound of his own power. He worried it would frighten those he loved, or draw enemies, or reveal something monstrous inside him. So he whispered, growled gently, and avoided confrontation."

The grandfather's voice took on the cadence of someone repeating words that had changed him. "But by suppressing his roar, the lion forgot how to use it. And when danger came, when a pack of wolves threatened his cubs, he froze. He tried to roar, but only a strangled sound came out. He had spent so long denying his power that when he needed it most, he couldn't access it. The wolves scattered his cubs, and the lion stood there, helpless, because he had never learned to control what he had been so afraid of."

The old man looked at his grandson. "The hermit told me: 'A controlled roar protects. An uncontrolled roar destroys. A suppressed roar suffocates. You have been suppressing your roar, and when it finally came out, it came out uncontrolled. That is not mastery. That is the absence of mastery.'"

"I asked him how to learn control," the grandfather continued. "And he said something I will never forget: 'You must practice your roar. Not in anger, not in fear, but with intention. Find a place where you can roar without hurting anyone. Learn the difference between a roar that protects and a roar that destroys. Learn when to use it, and when to hold it back. Your power is not your enemy. Your lack of mastery over it is.'"

"So I did," the grandfather said. "I went to that same spot in the woods every day. I practiced speaking my truth, standing firm, using my voice with intention. I learned to feel the fire inside me without letting it consume me. And when I saw Kael again, weeks later, he tried the same tactics. But this time, I didn't run, and I didn't explode. I stood my ground, and I spoke clearly: 'You will not harm my sister again. You will not harm anyone in my family. This ends now.'"

The old man's eyes brightened. "And do you know what happened? Kael backed down. Not because I threatened him, but because he saw that I was no longer afraid of my own power. I had learned to use it with control, and that made it more powerful, not less."

The grandfather leaned forward. "You have power within you, the power of your passion, your intensity, your strength. But you've been afraid of it, afraid that if you let it out, you'll hurt someone, or reveal something terrible about yourself. So you've tried to suppress it, to pretend it doesn't exist. But power denied becomes power distorted. Learn to use your roar wisely, not to intimidate or dominate, but to protect what matters, to speak truth when it needs to be spoken, to stand firm when standing firm is required. Your roar is not your enemy. Your lack of mastery over it is."

The old man's voice became gentle. "This is what happens to young men who fear their own intensity. They either suppress it entirely, or let it explode uncontrollably. Power must be mastered, not denied. Your dragon fears you learning this balance, because once you do, you will no longer be controlled by your fear of yourself."

**THE LESSON:** This parable teaches that **fearing one's own power creates either suppression or explosion**. The lion who feared his roar represents **fear** (of one's own intensity), **shame** (believing one's power is monstrous), and lack of mastery. Suppressing power doesn't eliminate it, it distorts it. When danger arrives, suppression leaves the warrior frozen, unable to access his strength. The binary trap: suppress entirely or explode uncontrollably. But a controlled roar protects; an uncontrolled roar destroys; a suppressed roar suffocates. **Technique:** The warrior must stop fearing his intensity. His power isn't monstrous, it's untrained. He must practice controlled expression: use his roar to protect what matters, speak truth, stand firm, not to intimidate. He must master his power through discipline, not denial. The dragon fears him learning this balance.
