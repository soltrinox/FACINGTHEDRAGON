## **What It Means to Face the Dragon**

The grandfather rose to his feet, standing tall despite his age, and looked down at his grandson with an expression of profound seriousness. "Facing your dragon is claiming ownership of everything you once fled from," he said. "When you go to face the dragon at dawn, understand this: You are not killing a monster. You are confronting your unhealed childhood, your fear of vulnerability, your wounded worth, your mistaken notions of respect, your habits of emotional withdrawal, your illusion that anger equals power, your belief that caring makes you weak."

He extended his hand to help his grandson stand, pulling him to his feet so they faced each other as equals. "But let me tell you how I learned this truth," the old man said, his voice carrying the weight of every mistake he'd ever made and every lesson he'd learned from them. "Because I did not understand it when I was your age. I had to face my own dragon, and it nearly destroyed me before I understood what it truly was."

The grandfather led his grandson back to the fire, and they sat together as the flames cast dancing shadows across their faces. "I was thirty-two years old when I finally went to face my dragon," he began. "I had spent years running from it, building walls around myself, hurting anyone who got too close. I had driven away my first wife, pushed away my closest friend, and broken the trust of my own brother. But I told myself I was strong, that I didn't need anyone, that my anger was my power."

He paused, staring into the fire as if seeing the past in its flames. "The morning I decided to face the dragon, I thought I was going to kill it. I sharpened my sword, prepared my armor, and walked into the cave where it lived, ready for battle. But when I entered that darkness, I did not find a monster waiting to fight me. Instead, I found a mirror—a mirror that showed me everything I had been running from."

The old man's voice grew quiet, as if speaking of something sacred. "In that mirror, I saw myself at sixteen, standing in my father's shadow, desperate for his approval and receiving only criticism. I saw myself at twenty, breaking the heart of a woman who loved me because I was too afraid to let her see my pain. I saw myself at twenty-five, turning my back on my brother when he needed me most, because I thought showing care would make me weak. I saw myself at thirty, destroying my own chance at happiness because I believed I didn't deserve it."

"But the dragon was not just showing me my past," the grandfather continued. "It was showing me the people I had hurt. And one of them stepped out of the shadows—my brother, Kael. The real Kael was far away, but this was the Kael I had created in my mind, the one who carried all my guilt and shame."

The grandfather's hands trembled slightly as he spoke. "This Kael looked at me with eyes full of pain, and he said, 'Do you remember when I came to you after our father died? I was broken, lost, drowning in grief. And what did you say to me?'"

"I remembered," the grandfather whispered. "I had said, 'Stop crying. Be a man. Grief is weakness.'"

"The Kael in the cave nodded, and his voice was heavy with sorrow. 'You were hurting too, weren't you? You were just as broken as I was. But you couldn't admit it, so you pushed me away. You made me feel ashamed for feeling what you were too afraid to feel yourself.'"

"I tried to defend myself," the grandfather said, his voice growing stronger with the memory. "I said, 'I was trying to make you strong! I was trying to help you!'"

"But Kael shook his head, and there was no anger in his voice, only truth. 'No, brother. You were trying to make yourself feel strong by making me feel weak. You were trying to prove that you didn't need anyone, that you were above pain, that you were invincible. But you weren't invincible. You were just alone.'"

The grandfather looked at his grandson, and tears glistened in his eyes. "And then Kael asked me the question that changed everything. He said, 'When did you stop caring about me? When did I become someone you could abandon?'"

"I wanted to say, 'I never stopped caring!' But the words wouldn't come, because they weren't true. I had stopped caring—or at least, I had stopped showing that I cared. I had built walls so high that even my own love couldn't reach through them. And I realized, in that moment, that the dragon wasn't a monster I needed to kill. It was every unhealed wound, every false belief, every defensive pattern I had built to protect myself from pain—patterns that had only created more pain."

The old man leaned forward, his voice urgent. "I looked at Kael—at the reflection of my brother that I had created from my own guilt—and I said the words I had never been able to say to the real Kael: 'I have been hurt. I have hurt you. I will do better.'"

"And do you know what happened?" the grandfather asked. "The Kael in the cave didn't attack me. He didn't condemn me. He simply nodded and said, 'That is the first honest thing you have said in fifteen years. Now you can begin to heal.'"

"The dragon wasn't my enemy," the grandfather said, his voice filled with wonder even after all these years. "It was my teacher. It showed me that I had been fighting the wrong battle. I thought I was fighting against vulnerability, against weakness, against pain. But I was really fighting against myself—against my own humanity, against my own need for connection, against my own capacity to love and be loved."

He placed both hands on his grandson's shoulders. "When you stand before the dragon, you will see reflected back at you every moment you lashed out in pain, every person you hurt because you couldn't admit you were hurting, every relationship you sabotaged because you were afraid of being abandoned first, every opportunity you destroyed because you felt you didn't deserve it. And you will have to look at all of it, not to punish yourself, but to understand yourself. Because only when you understand how you became who you are can you choose to become someone different."

The grandfather's grip tightened slightly. "The dragon taught me that facing it means accepting a simple truth: I have been hurt. I have hurt others. I will do better. That is the first act of a true warrior, not the boast of invincibility, not the claim of perfection, but the humble acknowledgment of your wounds and your responsibility. And from that acknowledgment, everything else becomes possible."

**THE LESSON:** This parable teaches that **facing the dragon means claiming ownership of what one has avoided**. The warrior is not killing a monster, he's confronting every unhealed wound, false belief, and defensive pattern he's built. This requires acknowledging **shame** (wounded worth), **fear** (of vulnerability), **grief** (unhealed childhood), and the illusions he's lived by. The warrior's first act is radical honesty: "I have been hurt. I have hurt others. I will do better." This isn't self-punishment; it's self-understanding. He'll see his pain-driven actions reflected back, not to drown in guilt but to understand his patterns. The dragon appears as those we've hurt, forcing us to see the truth of our actions and their consequences. **Technique:** The warrior must face the dragon by taking full ownership: list the ways he's hurt others while hurting, the relationships he's sabotaged, the opportunities he's destroyed. Understanding creates choice. He can't change what he won't acknowledge. The confrontation with those we've harmed—real or imagined—reveals the cost of our defenses and opens the path to genuine healing.
