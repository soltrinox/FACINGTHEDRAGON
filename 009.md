## **The Real Nature of the Dragon**

The grandfather stood slowly, his joints creaking, and walked to the edge of the firelight. He stared out into the darkness before turning back to his grandson. "The dragon is not your enemy. It is your unhealed story made into flesh," he said, his voice carrying a profound certainty. "You believe the dragon you face is outside you. But dragons are not born in caves, they are born in memories."

He returned to his seat, settling down with a sigh. "Your dragon is your hurt, your belief you were not enough, your shame, your anger, your loneliness, your pride. It is your unmet need for validation, your quiet wish to be understood, your fear that vulnerability will be used against you, your confusion about what respect truly means." The old man counted these off on his fingers, each one a piece of the beast. "The dragon is not there to kill you. It waits for you to claim mastery over yourself."

The grandson shifted uncomfortably. "But grandfather, how can you know this? How did you learn that the dragon isn't an enemy?"

The old man's eyes grew distant, seeing something far beyond the fire. "I learned it the hard way, boy. Let me tell you a story about when I was your age, when I first met my own dragon face to face."

He leaned back, the firelight dancing across his weathered features. "I was twenty-three, working as a blacksmith's apprentice in the village. There was a man named Kael, a master craftsman, respected by everyone. He had taken me under his wing, or so I thought. For three years, I worked from dawn until dusk, trying to earn his approval. But no matter how perfect my work, how hard I tried, he would find fault."

"One morning, I had spent the entire night crafting a sword blade, tempering it until it sang when struck. I presented it to Kael with pride, certain this time he would finally see my worth."

The grandfather's voice took on the cadence of memory, and the scene unfolded as if he were reliving it:

*"What is this?" Kael held the blade up to the light, his face a mask of disdain.*

*"It's the finest work I've ever done, Master Kael. The balance is perfect, the edge will hold, "*

*"Perfect?" Kael's laugh was sharp, cutting. "You call this perfect? Look at this line here, uneven. And the hilt? A child could do better. You think you're ready to be a master? You're barely fit to be an apprentice."*

*The words hit like physical blows. I felt heat rising in my chest, my hands clenching into fists. "I worked all night on this. I did everything you asked, "*

*"Everything I asked?" Kael's voice grew cold. "I asked for excellence. This is mediocrity. You disappoint me. You always have."*

*Something broke inside me then. The dragon awoke, a roaring, seething thing made of every time I'd been told I wasn't enough, every moment of shame, every unspoken need for someone to see my worth. I lunged at him, my fist connecting with his jaw before I even knew what I was doing.*

*Kael stumbled back, shock and then something else, was it satisfaction?, crossing his face. "There it is," he said, wiping blood from his lip. "The real you. The boy who can't control himself. The failure who responds to criticism with violence."*

*I stood there, trembling, the dragon raging inside me. I wanted to strike again, to destroy him, to make him see what he'd done to me. But even as the rage consumed me, a small voice whispered: This isn't him. This is you. This is what you've become.*

The grandfather paused, his eyes returning to the present. "I ran from that forge and didn't return for three days. I wandered the hills, consumed by anger, by shame, by the belief that I was everything Kael said I was, a failure, a boy who couldn't control himself, unworthy of respect."

"What happened?" the grandson asked, leaning forward.

"I met an old hermit who lived in a cave above the village. He found me sitting by a stream, throwing stones at my reflection in the water. 'You're trying to break the image,' he said, 'but the water will always show you what's there.'"

*"Leave me alone," I snarled, the dragon still coiled tight in my chest.*

*"What are you fighting?" the hermit asked, sitting beside me.*

*"Kael. He's, he's been destroying me for years. Every word, every criticism, every moment of, "*

*"Is he here now?"*

*I looked around. "No, but, "*

*"Then who are you fighting?"*

*The question stopped me. I looked at my hands, still clenched into fists. I felt the tension in my shoulders, the heat in my chest. "I'm fighting... myself?"*

*"Tell me," the hermit said gently, "what did Kael's words touch in you?"*

*I wanted to dismiss the question, but something in his tone made me pause. "They touched... the part of me that believes I'm not enough. The part that's ashamed. The part that's been waiting, always waiting, for someone to finally see my worth."*

*"And when he didn't see it, what happened?"*

*"The dragon came. The rage, the need to destroy him, to make him pay, "*

*"But the dragon wasn't attacking Kael, was it?" the hermit pressed. "It was attacking you. Every moment of rage was a moment you spent hating yourself for needing his approval. Every thought of violence was a thought of destroying the part of you that felt hurt, that felt unworthy."*

*I stared at him, the truth of it washing over me like cold water. "The dragon... it's not my enemy. It's my pain. It's everything I've been trying to destroy in myself."*

*"Exactly," the hermit said. "The dragon guards your wounds. It protects the boy who was never seen, never validated, never told he was enough. And when you try to kill the dragon, you're trying to kill that boy. But that boy is you. You cannot destroy him without destroying yourself."*

*"Then what do I do?" I asked, desperation in my voice.*

*"You face the dragon. You ask it: What pain are you protecting? What feelings have I been denying? You listen to its answer. And when you understand, truly understand, that it was never your enemy, that it was always the guardian of your wounded heart, then it transforms. It becomes your teacher."*


*"I'm sorry I struck you," I said. "That wasn't about you. That was about me, about the part of me that believes I'm not enough, that needs your approval to feel worthy. I've been trying to destroy that part of myself, but I can't. It's part of who I am."*

*Kael set down his hammer, studying me. "And now?"*

*"Now I see that the dragon, my rage, my shame, my need, it's not my enemy. It's showing me what I need to heal. I don't need your approval to be worthy. I need to give myself the approval I've been seeking from others."*

*To my surprise, Kael nodded. "It took you three years to learn what I've been trying to teach you. A master doesn't need validation from others. A master knows his own worth. But you had to discover that yourself. I couldn't give it to you."*

*"You were trying to teach me?"*

*"Every criticism was a test. Would you find your worth within yourself, or would you keep seeking it from me? Today, you passed."*

The grandfather looked at his grandson. "That's how I learned the truth. The dragon isn't external, it's the unhealed parts of ourselves made manifest. Kael wasn't my enemy; he was a mirror showing me what I needed to see. The real enemy was my belief that I needed his approval to be whole. The dragon was the guardian of that wounded belief, and when I stopped trying to destroy it and instead asked what it was protecting, I discovered my own worth."

He leaned in close, his voice dropping to an intense whisper. "If you strike the dragon blindly, you strike your own heart. You cannot kill it with violence because it is made of the parts of yourself you've been trying to destroy. Every blow you land on it is a blow against your own humanity, your own capacity to feel, your own right to have been hurt and to have responded imperfectly to that hurt." He pulled back, his voice rising again. "But if you face it with clarity, you slay the illusions that chained you. You see that the dragon was never the monster, it was the guardian of your pain, the protector of the wounded boy, the keeper of the feelings you were never allowed to express. And once you understand this, the dragon transforms from enemy to teacher."

**THE LESSON:** This parable teaches that **the dragon is not external, it's unintegrated pain personified**. Every suppressed feeling, unmet need, and unhealed wound combines to create the beast. This involves **shame** (believing one is not enough), **anxiety** (fear of vulnerability), **loneliness** (unmet need for understanding), and **grief** (mourning what was never received). The dragon isn't the warrior's enemy, it's the guardian of his wounded inner child, protecting feelings he was never allowed to express. Attacking it means attacking himself. **Technique:** The warrior must stop trying to destroy the dragon through force or suppression. Instead, he must approach it with curiosity: "What pain are you protecting? What feelings have I been denying?" The dragon dissolves when he acknowledges and integrates what it guards. Mastery comes through understanding, not violence.
