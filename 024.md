## **The Unfinished Mask**

The grandfather's voice became almost hypnotic, drawing his grandson deeper into the story. "A man wears a mask to hide his fear, but eventually he forgets he is wearing it," he said. "Listen closely, for this truth is subtle, and I learned it the hard way."

The old man settled back, his eyes seeing something far away. "Our tribe once held a festival where each warrior carved a mask representing the face he showed the world. It was a test of self-awareness, a chance to examine one's inner truth. I was twenty-three, already known for my strength and my temper. I thought I knew exactly who I was."

He paused, gathering the memory. "I carved mine with care over three days: stern brow, fierce jaw, eyes that burned with certainty. Every line was sharp, every angle severe. When I finished, I held it up and thought, 'This is me. This is how they see me. This is how I want them to see me.'"

"The festival began at sunset. The elders gathered us in the circle and gave us the rule: 'Wear your mask for one night. Dance with it, speak with it, live with it. But at dawn, you must remove it and look upon your true face in the mirror of the sacred pool.'"

The grandfather's voice took on the cadence of memory. "I put on my mask and immediately felt safer. Behind it, I could hide everything I feared they might see, my doubts about whether I was truly brave, my insecurities about whether I deserved respect, the trembling boy inside who still wondered if he was enough. The mask made me feel invincible."

"That night, I danced with a confidence I had never felt. Warriors approached me, their own masks hiding their true faces, and I spoke with authority I didn't truly possess. 'The mask suits you,' one said. 'You look like a true leader,' another told me. I believed them. I believed the mask was me."

"But there was one person who saw through it. An elder named Kaelen, a man who had lost an eye in battle and saw more clearly with the one that remained. He watched me all evening, and when the dancing slowed, he approached me."

The grandfather's voice shifted, becoming the elder's measured tone. "'Young warrior,' Kaelen said, 'your mask is impressive. But tell me, what does it hide?'"

"I stood straighter, my voice coming from behind the carved wood. 'It hides nothing, Elder. This is who I am.'"

"'Is it?' Kaelen's single eye seemed to pierce through the mask. 'Then why do you wear it so tightly? Why do you flinch when someone looks too closely? A mask that shows truth needs no defense.'"

"I felt anger rising, the safe, familiar anger that always protected me. 'You question my honor, Elder?'"

"'I question your honesty with yourself,' Kaelen replied calmly. 'The mask is meant to reveal, not conceal. If you cannot remove it, it has already become your prison.'"

"His words stung because they touched something I didn't want to acknowledge. 'I can remove it whenever I choose,' I said, my voice tight."

"'Then remove it now,' Kaelen challenged. 'Show me your true face.'"

The grandfather's voice grew quiet. "I reached up, my fingers finding the edges of the mask. But something stopped me. A fear I couldn't name. What if my real face was weak? What if they saw the doubt, the fear, the boy who wasn't sure he belonged? I let my hand fall."

"'I will remove it at dawn, as the elders instructed,' I said, my voice defensive even to my own ears."

"Kaelen nodded slowly, sadly. 'The instruction was to remove it at dawn. But the lesson was to understand why you cannot remove it now. You have already forgotten it is a mask. You believe it is your face.'"

"He walked away, leaving me standing there, the mask suddenly feeling heavy, the wood pressing against my skin. I spent the rest of the night avoiding mirrors, avoiding still water, avoiding anything that might show me my reflection and remind me that I was wearing something artificial."

"At dawn, the elders called us to the sacred pool. One by one, the other warriors removed their masks. Some laughed with relief. Some wept. Some looked surprised at their own faces, as if seeing themselves for the first time. But when it came to me, I hesitated."

The old man's voice became the young man's internal struggle. "I stood at the edge of the pool, mask still on, and the others watched. 'Remove it,' the head elder commanded. My hands shook. I tried to pull it away, but it felt as if it had fused to my skin. The edges seemed to dig into my flesh. I pulled harder, and pain shot through my face."

"'It won't come off,' I said, panic rising in my voice."

"Kaelen stepped forward. 'It will come off. But first, you must admit it is a mask. You must admit you are afraid of what lies beneath.'"

"'I'm not afraid,' I insisted, but my voice cracked."

"'Then why does your hand tremble?' Kaelen asked gently. 'Why do you fear the face beneath? What do you think they will see that is so terrible?'"

The grandfather paused, his eyes meeting his grandson's. "In that moment, I understood something I had never allowed myself to know. I was afraid they would see that I was ordinary. That I doubted myself. That I wasn't the invincible warrior I pretended to be. I was afraid they would see me, just me, and find me wanting."

"Kaelen's voice softened. 'The mask you carved shows strength. But the face beneath also shows strength, the strength to be vulnerable, to be human, to be real. That is a different kind of courage, and it is rarer.'"

"Something broke inside me. I took a deep breath, and with shaking hands, I pulled the mask away. It came free with a sound like tearing cloth, and I felt the cool air on my real face for the first time in hours. I looked into the pool, and I saw myself, not the stern warrior, but a young man with fear in his eyes, with uncertainty, with hope, with all the things I had tried to hide."

"'This is you,' Kaelen said. 'This is the man who is strong enough to be afraid, brave enough to doubt, courageous enough to be vulnerable. This is the face worthy of respect.'"


His voice grew strained. "The problem with masks is that they become heavy. They restrict breath. They cut into the skin. They separate the wearer from the world. And when I finally tried to remove it, truly remove it, not just for one night, I discovered it had molded to my face. I had to learn to peel it away slowly, piece by piece, over many years."

The grandfather leaned forward urgently. "This is what happens to young men who grow up believing they must always look strong. Their mask becomes their prison. They forget what their real face looks like. They forget how to smile genuinely, how to cry freely, how to show fear without shame, how to express joy without self-consciousness. Every interaction becomes a performance, every relationship becomes exhausting, because they can never let anyone see who they really are."

He reached out and touched his grandson's cheek gently. "Your dragon is not only the beast of anger, it is also the mask of invulnerability that prevents you from living freely. Take off the mask before it fuses to your skin. Let people see the real you, the one who hurts, who doubts, who fears, who hopes, who cares. That is the man worthy of true respect, not the false face you show the world. I learned this from Kaelen, but more importantly, I learned it from the years I spent trapped behind my own mask, watching life pass me by because I was too afraid to show my true face."

**THE LESSON:** This parable teaches that **performed invulnerability becomes a prison one can't escape**. The mask represents the false self shown to the world, stern, fierce, certain, hiding **shame** (fear of not being enough), **fear** (of being seen as weak), and vulnerability. Worn too long, the mask molds to one's face, making the warrior forget his real self. Every interaction becomes performance; every relationship exhausts him. He loses the ability to smile genuinely, cry freely, show fear, or express joy. The mask separates him from authentic connection. **Technique:** The warrior must identify his mask, what face does he show the world to hide his true self? He must practice removing it incrementally: share one doubt, express one fear, show one moment of genuine emotion. Let people see the real him before the mask permanently fuses. Authenticity, not performance, earns true respect.
