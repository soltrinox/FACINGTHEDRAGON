## **The Empty Quiver**

The young man stormed into the clearing where his grandfather sat by the fire, his face flushed with anger. "That merchant in the village, he looked at me like I was nothing. I should have made him respect me!"

"Should have what?" the grandfather asked calmly, not looking up from the fire.

"He dismissed me, grandfather. Acted like I was beneath him. I won't stand for that kind of disrespect." The grandson's hands clenched into fists.

The grandfather mimed pulling an arrow from an invisible quiver at his side. "A warrior must choose his arrows wisely, or he will shoot anything that moves," he said, finally looking at his grandson. "When I was young, I carried a quiver filled with arrows of all kinds: an arrow of anger, an arrow of pride, an arrow of jealousy, an arrow of fear, an arrow of shame, an arrow of distrust. Whenever I felt threatened, I fired one at the closest target."

He counted on his fingers, his voice taking on a rhythm of regret. "Someone disappointed me, I fired. Someone questioned me, I fired. Someone ignored me, I fired. Someone wounded me, I fired. But soon my quiver was empty. And when a real threat emerged, I had nothing left." The old man looked at his grandson seriously. "Let me tell you how I learned this lesson."

* * *

"When I was twenty-one, I was the most reactive young man in our tribe. Every slight, real or imagined, demanded a response. Every look, every word, every moment of inattention became a battle I had to win. I carried my quiver everywhere, and I fired arrows constantly."

The grandfather's eyes grew distant, seeing the past. "There was a day, I remember it clearly, when I fired six arrows before noon. My sister asked for help, and I fired an arrow of anger. A friend joked about my skills, and I fired an arrow of pride. A woman smiled at another man, and I fired an arrow of jealousy. An elder corrected me, and I fired an arrow of shame. A stranger didn't return my greeting, and I fired an arrow of distrust. My own reflection showed me a face I didn't recognize, and I fired an arrow of fear."

"By midday, my quiver was half-empty, and I was exhausted. But I didn't stop. When my father asked why I hadn't completed my tasks, I fired another arrow. When my mother suggested I rest, I fired another. Each arrow left me more drained, but I couldn't stop. I thought firing arrows was strength."

The old man's voice grew heavy. "That evening, as the sun was setting, a real threat came to our village. Raiders from the northern tribes, known for their brutality, had been spotted approaching. The alarm was sounded, and every warrior was called to defend our homes and families."

"I reached for my quiver, ready to fight, ready to protect what mattered. But when I looked inside, I found only three arrows remaining. Three arrows against a dozen raiders. I had fired all my strength at ghosts, at perceived slights, at imagined threats. I had nothing left for the real battle."

The grandfather's hands trembled slightly as he continued. "I stood there, my quiver nearly empty, watching the other warriors prepare. My friend Marcus, who had been the target of my arrow of pride that morning, saw my face and came to me."

*"What's wrong?" Marcus asked, already stringing his bow.*

*"I'm out of arrows," I said, my voice barely a whisper. "I fired them all today. At nothing. At everything. I have nothing left."*

*Marcus looked at me, and I expected judgment. But instead, he reached into his own quiver and pulled out five arrows, handing them to me.*

*"Take these," he said. "But understand: you cannot keep firing at shadows and expect to have strength when the real enemy arrives."*

*"I thought I was being strong," I said, my voice breaking. "I thought I was defending my honor."*

*"You were defending against threats that didn't exist," Marcus replied. "You were fighting battles that didn't need to be fought. And now, when we face a real enemy, you have nothing. That is not strength, my friend. That is weakness disguised as strength."*

"The raiders attacked, and I fought with the arrows Marcus had given me. We drove them off, but not before they had wounded several of our people. I spent the night tending to the injured, my hands shaking. I kept thinking: what if I had saved my arrows? What if I had asked myself, before each reaction, 'Is this worth an arrow? Is this a real threat or just my wounded pride?'"


"I asked him how to know the difference. He said: 'Before you fire an arrow, ask yourself three questions: Is this worth an arrow? Is this a real threat or a perceived slight? Will firing this arrow serve a purpose or just deplete me?'"

The old man's voice became instructive. "I began practicing this discipline. When someone disappointed me, I asked: Is this worth an arrow? Usually, no. When someone questioned me, I asked: Is this a real threat or just my pride? Usually, just my pride. When someone ignored me, I asked: Will reacting serve a purpose or just deplete me? Usually, it would just deplete me."

"At first, it felt like weakness. But slowly, I saw the truth: I had been creating most of the conflicts. I had been turning minor moments into major battles. I had been exhausting myself on fights that didn't matter."

"Months passed, and I conserved my arrows. I learned to let small slights pass, to save my strength for what truly mattered. Then, one day, a real threat emerged, a dispute that threatened to tear our tribe apart. I had arrows. I had strength. I had the discipline to use them wisely."

The grandfather mimed pulling an arrow from his quiver again, then slowly putting it back. "This is how I learned the lesson: through failure, through nearly losing everything, through the wisdom of a friend. I learned that reactive emotional spending exhausts your resources. Not every feeling requires action. Discipline means discerning what truly matters versus what's mere discomfort."

He looked at his grandson, who had been listening intently. "The merchant in the village, did he actually threaten you? Did he harm you? Did he pose a danger to what you value?"

The grandson shifted uncomfortably. "No, he just... he just looked at me in a way I didn't like."

"Then you were about to fire an arrow at a ghost," the grandfather said gently. "Save your arrows for real threats, grandson. Save your strength for the battles that truly matter, like the dragon awaiting you. When you learn to conserve your emotional energy, you'll find you have more strength than you ever imagined when you actually need it."

**THE LESSON:** This parable teaches that **reactive emotional spending exhausts one's resources**. Each emotional arrow (anger, pride, jealousy, fear, shame, distrust) fired at minor provocations depletes strength. This reflects **rejection sensitivity** (seeing threats everywhere), **catastrophizing** (elevating minor slights to major offenses), and **all-or-nothing thinking** (every disagreement is a battle). Firing at ghosts, perceived slights, imagined disrespect, leaves the warrior empty when real threats emerge. Discipline means discerning what truly matters versus what's mere discomfort. **Technique:** Before reacting, the warrior must ask: "Is this worth an arrow? Is this a real threat or a perceived slight? Will firing this arrow serve a purpose or just deplete me?" He must conserve emotional energy for battles that truly matter. Not every feeling requires action.
