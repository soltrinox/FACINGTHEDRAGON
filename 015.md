## **The Unseen Wound**

The grandson sat with his arms crossed, staring at the fire. Three days had passed since the incident in the village, and he had not spoken of it. The grandfather watched him, recognizing the familiar pattern, the tight jaw, the forced calm, the way his grandson's eyes avoided meeting his own.

"You're limping," the grandfather said quietly.

"I'm fine," the grandson replied, his voice flat. "It's nothing."

The grandfather moved closer, settling beside him. "Nothing that makes you walk like an old man with a bad hip?"

"It doesn't matter," the grandson snapped, then caught himself. "I mean, it's just a scrape. I'll be fine."

The grandfather was silent for a long moment. Then he pulled up his pant leg, revealing a thick, white scar that ran from his knee down to his ankle, a jagged line of raised tissue that spoke of old pain.

"The deepest wounds are those we pretend do not exist," he said. "Let me tell you about the time I nearly died from a scrape."

The grandson shifted, still avoiding his grandfather's eyes, but he did not leave.

"I was seventeen," the grandfather began. "Younger than you are now. My friend Kael and I were hunting in the northern woods. We'd been tracking a deer for hours, and I was eager to prove myself. I wanted to show Kael that I was strong, capable, that I didn't need help. That was my first mistake, believing that needing help was weakness."

He paused, watching the fire. "We came to a ravine. The deer had crossed it, and I was determined to follow. Kael warned me: 'The rocks are loose. Take the long way around.' But I was young and proud. I said, 'I'm fine. I can handle it.'"

The grandfather's voice took on the cadence of memory. "I started down the slope, and halfway across, my foot slipped. I fell hard, and a sharp stone sliced through my pant leg and into my calf. The cut wasn't deep, just a scrape, really. But it bled, and it stung."

"Kael came down after me. 'Let me see it,' he said. But I was embarrassed. I'd fallen because I'd been reckless, and now I was bleeding. So I pulled my pant leg down and said, 'It's nothing. Just a scratch. I'm fine.'"

"Kael looked at me, and I'll never forget the expression on his face, part concern, part frustration. 'You're bleeding through your pants,' he said. 'Let me clean it. We have water and herbs.'"

"But I was stubborn. I stood up, testing my weight on the leg. It hurt, but I could walk. 'See?' I said. 'I'm fine. It doesn't matter. Let's keep going.'"

The grandfather's voice grew heavier. "Kael tried again. 'A wound in the wild is dangerous. Even a small one can fester. Let me tend it now, while it's fresh.'"

"But I wouldn't listen. I was too proud. Too afraid that if I admitted the wound hurt, if I let him help me, I would look weak. So I said, 'I said I'm fine. Stop treating me like a child.'"

"Kael's face hardened. 'Fine,' he said. 'But when it gets infected, don't come crying to me.'"

The grandfather fell silent for a moment. "We continued the hunt. I walked on that leg for two more days. Each day, it hurt more. Each day, I pretended it didn't. I wrapped it in a dirty cloth when Kael wasn't looking, but I never cleaned it. I never asked for help. I just kept saying, 'I'm fine. It doesn't matter.'"

"By the third day, I could barely walk. The wound had swollen, and it was hot to the touch. But still, I said nothing. I was determined to prove I was strong. That I didn't need help. That the wound didn't matter."

"On the fourth day, I collapsed. The fever hit me like a hammer. I was shaking, sweating, delirious. The wound had festered, and the infection had spread. Kael found me curled up by our campfire, unable to stand."

The grandfather's voice became urgent, as if reliving the moment. "Kael didn't say 'I told you so.' He didn't lecture me. He just knelt beside me and said, 'You're going to die if we don't clean this wound. Right now. Will you let me help you, or will your pride kill you?'"

"I was too weak to argue. Too scared. So I nodded, and Kael cut away my pant leg. The wound was black and oozing. It smelled of rot. He cleaned it with water and herbs, and the pain was excruciating. I screamed. I cried. I begged him to stop. But he didn't. He kept cleaning, kept cutting away the dead flesh, kept working until the wound was clean."

"He saved my life that day. But more than that, he taught me something I've never forgotten."

The grandfather looked directly at his grandson now. "I learned that pretending a wound doesn't exist doesn't make it go away. It makes it worse. I learned that saying 'I'm fine' when you're not fine isn't strength, it's self-destruction. I learned that asking for help isn't weakness, it's wisdom. And I learned that the deepest wounds, the ones that poison everything, are the ones we refuse to acknowledge."

He leaned forward. "Emotional wounds behave the same way. Abandonment. Humiliation. Failure. Rejection. Loss. Loneliness. Being misunderstood. Being silenced. Being hit. Being forgotten. A young man learns to hide these wounds. To pretend they do not exist. To say 'It doesn't matter.' To say 'I'm fine.' But the wounds remain. They fester. They become anger. Addiction. Rage. Self-destruction. Isolation. And eventually, dragons."

The grandson's jaw was still tight, but his eyes had found the fire again, and there was something softer in his expression.

"Your dragon is an infected wound made into a monster," the grandfather said. "Clean it. Face it. Heal it. Stop pretending you're fine when you're not. Stop saying it doesn't matter when it does. Stop hiding your pain as if acknowledging it makes you weak. The wound will not heal if you refuse to tend it. And an untended wound will poison everything in your life, your relationships, your peace, your future."

He reached out and placed a hand on his grandson's shoulder. "Face the wound, grandson. It's the only way to stop the infection from spreading."

The grandson was quiet for a long time. Then, in a voice barely above a whisper, he said, "They laughed at me. In the village. They said I was weak. That I couldn't protect anyone."

The grandfather's hand tightened on his shoulder. "And that hurt you."

"Yes," the grandson said, and his voice cracked. "It hurt. It still hurts."

"Good," the grandfather said. "Now we can tend it. Now we can heal it. But first, you had to stop pretending it didn't exist."

**THE LESSON:** This parable teaches that **ignored emotional wounds fester into destructive patterns**. The small physical wound that nearly killed the grandfather represents **abandonment**, **grief**, **loneliness**, **shame**, wounds the warrior pretends don't exist. Saying "It doesn't matter" or "I'm fine" doesn't heal them; it allows them to fester into anger, addiction, rage, self-destruction, isolation, and dragons. Untended wounds poison everything, relationships, peace, future. This involves **survival mode thinking** (pretending one is fine as protection) and **emotional reasoning** (believing acknowledgment equals weakness). **Technique:** The warrior must stop pretending. He must identify his hidden wounds. He must ask: "What pain am I refusing to acknowledge?" Face it, clean it, tend it. Acknowledging wounds isn't weakness, it's the only path to healing. The dragon is an infected wound made monster. Stop the infection by facing it.
