## **How Respect Became a Path to Violence**

The grandfather's expression darkened, and he spoke with the weight of hard-earned wisdom. "Respect demanded out of fear is hollow. Respect earned out of character is eternal," he said. "You learned to see respect as something you must force because no one ever gave it freely. A young man who has never been respected for who he is tries to be respected for what he can do, for his strength, his anger, his ability to intimidate or dominate."

He leaned forward, his weathered hands clasped together. "Let me tell you a story about how I learned this, grandson. It happened when I was twenty-three, newly made captain of the border guard. I thought I had earned the position through skill and strength, but in truth, I had bullied my way there. I saw every challenge as a test of dominance, every disagreement as an insult to my authority."

The old man's eyes grew distant, seeing another time. "There was a man under my command named Kael. He was older than me, quieter, but he had a way with the younger guards. They listened to him, asked his advice, laughed at his stories. I watched this and felt something dark coil in my chest. Why did they seek him out? Why did they respect him? I was their captain. I was stronger, faster, more skilled with a blade. Yet when I entered a room, the laughter stopped. When I spoke, they nodded and fell silent. I told myself this was respect, but I knew it was fear."

The grandfather's voice took on the cadence of memory. "One evening, I found Kael sitting by the fire with three of the guards, teaching them how to read the tracks of wild game. I stood in the shadows and watched. They were leaning in, asking questions, genuinely interested. When I stepped into the firelight, they all straightened, their faces going blank. Kael looked up and nodded. 'Captain,' he said simply."

"'What are you doing?' I demanded, though I could see perfectly well what he was doing."

"'Teaching them to track, Captain,' Kael replied calmly. 'It might save their lives one day.'"

"'I didn't authorize this,' I said, my voice rising. 'You're not their instructor. You're a guard, same as them.'"

"Kael stood slowly, and I saw something in his eyes I didn't understand then, not fear, not anger, but something like pity. 'Captain, they asked me to teach them. I thought it would help the unit.'"

"'You thought?' I stepped closer, using my height and bulk to intimidate. 'You don't think. You follow orders. You respect the chain of command. Is that clear?'"

"The other guards had gone completely still. Kael looked at me for a long moment, then said quietly, 'Yes, Captain. I understand.'"

"'Good,' I said, turning to the others. 'And the rest of you, find something useful to do. Stop wasting time.'"

"They scattered immediately. I felt a surge of satisfaction. I had asserted my authority. I had made them respect me. But as I walked away, I heard one of them whisper to another: 'Why does he have to be such an ass?' And the other replied: 'Just keep your head down. He'll find something else to be angry about soon enough.'"

The grandfather's shoulders sagged. "That should have been my first lesson, but I was too blind to see it. I thought their obedience meant respect. I thought their silence meant deference. But I was wrong."

"Two weeks later, we were on patrol near the northern pass when we spotted raiders. There were eight of them, well-armed, moving toward a small settlement. We were only five. I ordered an immediate attack, but Kael spoke up: 'Captain, if we wait until nightfall, we can, '"

"'I gave an order!' I snapped. 'We attack now. That's final.'"

"Kael's jaw tightened, but he nodded. 'Yes, Captain.'"

"We attacked. It was chaos. The raiders were ready for us, and we were outnumbered. In the fighting, one of the younger guards, a boy named Tomas, took an arrow to the leg. He went down hard, and a raider moved in to finish him. I was too far away, engaged with two others. But Kael, who had positioned himself differently despite my orders, was close enough. He threw himself between Tomas and the raider, taking a blade meant for the boy. The raider's sword cut deep into Kael's side."

"We drove the raiders off, but Kael was bleeding badly. As we carried him back to camp, he looked at me and said, 'Captain, I know you think I disobeyed you. But I saw Tomas fall, and I couldn't, '"

"'You should have followed orders!' I shouted, my voice cracking with something I didn't recognize. 'If you had stayed in position, this wouldn't have happened!'"

"Kael's eyes met mine, and in that moment, I saw something that would haunt me for years. Not anger. Not accusation. Just sadness. 'Captain,' he said quietly, 'do you think they follow you because they respect you, or because they're afraid of you?'"

"I stared at him, speechless. He continued, his voice weak but clear: 'I've watched you. You demand respect through fear. You think obedience is the same as respect. But they don't respect you. They endure you. They wait for you to turn your back. They celebrate when you fail.' He paused, wincing from the pain. 'I tried to teach them because I cared about them. You command them because you need to feel powerful. There's a difference.'"

"Kael survived, but he never fully recovered. He left the guard a month later. And I was left with his words echoing in my mind. I began to watch more carefully. I saw how the guards relaxed when I wasn't around. I heard their laughter stop when I entered a room. I noticed how they never came to me with problems, never asked my advice, never sought my company. They obeyed me, yes. But they did not respect me."

The grandfather's voice grew heavy with regret. "The real lesson came months later. I was walking through the camp at night when I heard voices. I stopped, hidden in the shadows. It was three of the guards, sitting around a small fire, talking quietly."

"'I miss Kael,' one said. 'He actually cared about us.'"

"'The captain doesn't care about anyone but himself,' another replied. 'He just needs to feel important.'"

"'I know,' the third said. 'But what can we do? He's the captain. We just have to put up with it until he's gone.'"

"'Or until someone better comes along,' the first one said, and they all laughed bitterly."

The old man closed his eyes. "I stood there in the darkness, listening to them speak about me with such casual contempt. And I realized: Kael was right. They didn't respect me. They feared me. They endured me. They waited for me to be gone. And I had done this to myself. I had confused fear with respect, obedience with loyalty, dominance with leadership."

"I learned that night that real respect cannot be demanded. It cannot be forced. It cannot be extracted through fear or intimidation. True respect comes when people see you make the hard choice, when you control your temper when you have every right to unleash it, when you show mercy when you have the power to destroy, when you admit fault when you could easily blame others, when you put the needs of your tribe above your own wounded pride."

The grandfather looked directly at his grandson. "I spent years trying to force people to respect me through fear and intimidation. And yes, they obeyed me. But they did not respect me. They waited for me to turn my back. They celebrated when I failed. They felt relief when I left the room. That is not respect, that is tyranny. And tyranny breeds only resentment and rebellion."

**THE LESSON:** This parable reveals how **unearned respect sought through force creates tyranny, not dignity**. When a warrior has never been respected for his inherent worth, he tries to extract it through dominance, intimidation, and aggression. This reflects **emotional entitlement** (demanding compensation for childhood deprivation) and **all-or-nothing thinking** (either I dominate or I'm nothing). Fear-based respect is hollow, it breeds resentment, not loyalty. True respect comes from character demonstrated when no one watches: self-control, mercy, accountability, and prioritizing others over wounded pride. **Technique:** The warrior must ask himself: "Do people respect me or fear me? Do they seek my presence or endure it?" He must shift from demanding respect to earning it through consistent character. He must make the hard choice to control his temper, admit fault, show mercy. This builds authentic respect that doesn't require constant enforcement.
