# CRISIS RESOURCES AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS

## **When the Work Becomes Too Much: How to Stay Safe While Healing**

This section is here to protect you. Healing work is powerful, but it can also be overwhelming. Your safety matters more than completing any exercise or reading any chapter. This guide will help you recognize when you need to pause, how to ground yourself when emotions become too intense, and when to seek additional support.

---

## **WHEN TO PAUSE THE WORK**

**Stop immediately if you experience:**

- Overwhelming emotional distress that doesn't subside after using grounding techniques
- Thoughts of self-harm or suicide
- Intense panic attacks that last more than 20 minutes
- Feeling completely disconnected from reality (dissociation)
- Inability to sleep or eat for more than 24 hours due to emotional distress
- Flashbacks or intrusive memories that feel uncontrollable
- Physical symptoms like chest pain, difficulty breathing, or severe headaches related to emotional stress

**Pause and return later if you experience:**

- Feeling emotionally drained or exhausted
- Difficulty concentrating or thinking clearly
- Increased irritability or anger that feels unmanageable
- Feeling numb or disconnected from your emotions
- Physical tension or pain that increases significantly
- Difficulty sleeping after working with difficult material

**Remember:** There is no timeline for healing. Taking care of yourself is not weakness—it's wisdom. The work will still be here when you're ready to return.

## **GROUNDING TECHNIQUES FOR EMOTIONAL OVERLOAD**


### **5-4-3-2-1 Sensory Grounding**

This technique uses your five senses to anchor you in the present:

1. **Name 5 things you can see** (look around and name specific objects)
2. **Name 4 things you can touch** (feel the texture of your clothes, the surface you're sitting on)
3. **Name 3 things you can hear** (listen to sounds near and far)
4. **Name 2 things you can smell** (or 2 smells you remember)
5. **Name 1 thing you can taste** (or take a sip of water and notice the taste)

Repeat this process until you feel more grounded.

### **Breathing Techniques**

**Box Breathing:**
1. Breathe in slowly for 4 counts
2. Hold your breath for 4 counts
3. Breathe out slowly for 4 counts
4. Hold for 4 counts
5. Repeat 4-6 times

**4-7-8 Breathing:**
1. Breathe in through your nose for 4 counts
2. Hold your breath for 7 counts
3. Breathe out through your mouth for 8 counts
4. Repeat 3-4 times

### **Physical Grounding**

- **Stand up and stretch** - Reach your arms up, roll your shoulders, move your body
- **Splash cold water on your face** - The temperature change helps reset your nervous system
- **Hold something solid** - A pen, a book, the edge of a table. Focus on the physical sensation
- **Press your feet into the floor** - Feel the connection to the ground beneath you
- **Tense and release** - Tense your muscles for 5 seconds, then release. Start with your hands, then arms, shoulders, legs

### **Mental Grounding**

- **Count backwards from 100 by 7s** (100, 93, 86, 79...)
- **Name all the states/provinces you can remember**
- **Recite something you know by heart** (a poem, song lyrics, prayer)
- **Describe your surroundings in detail** - "I am sitting on a chair. The chair is made of metal. The floor is concrete. There is a window to my left..."

### **Emotional Grounding**

- **Name the emotion** - "I am feeling overwhelmed" or "I am feeling scared"
- **Remind yourself where you are** - "I am safe right now. I am in [location]. The year is [year]. I am [age] years old."
- **Remind yourself this will pass** - "This feeling is temporary. I have felt this before and it passed. This will pass too."
- **Speak to yourself with compassion** - "It's okay to feel this. This is a normal response to difficult work. I am doing my best."

## **SAFETY PROTOCOLS FOR TRAUMA PROCESSING**

### **Before Starting Difficult Work**

1. **Choose the right time** - Don't work with traumatic material when you're already stressed, tired, or triggered
2. **Create a safe space** - Find a place where you feel relatively safe and won't be interrupted
3. **Have grounding techniques ready** - Know which techniques work best for you
4. **Set a time limit** - Decide how long you'll work (start with 15-30 minutes)
5. **Have a plan for after** - Know what you'll do when you finish (gentle activity, connection with someone safe, rest)

### **During Difficult Work**

1. **Check in with yourself every 10-15 minutes** - Ask: "How am I doing? Do I need to pause?"
2. **Use grounding techniques as needed** - Don't wait until you're completely overwhelmed
3. **Take breaks** - Stand up, move around, breathe
4. **Stay in the present** - If you find yourself reliving trauma, use grounding to come back to now
5. **Remember: You're observing, not reliving** - You're looking at the past from the safety of the present

### **After Difficult Work**

1. **Do a grounding exercise** - Use one of the techniques above
2. **Do something gentle** - Read something light, listen to music, take a walk if possible
3. **Connect with someone safe** - If you have someone you trust, check in with them
4. **Be kind to yourself** - You just did hard work. Rest. Be gentle.
5. **Don't judge your reactions** - Whatever you feel is valid. There's no "right" way to process trauma.

## **SIGNS YOU MAY NEED PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT**

While this book is designed to be self-directed, there are times when professional support is important. Consider seeking additional help if you experience:

### **Mental Health Warning Signs**

- **Persistent thoughts of suicide or self-harm** - If you have a plan or means, seek immediate help
- **Inability to function in daily life** - Can't eat, sleep, or complete basic tasks for extended periods
- **Severe depression** - Feeling hopeless, worthless, or that life isn't worth living for more than a few days
- **Severe anxiety** - Panic attacks that interfere with daily life, constant worry that feels unmanageable
- **Substance use to cope** - Using drugs or alcohol to numb feelings related to this work
- **Psychotic symptoms** - Hearing voices, seeing things that aren't there, believing things that aren't real
- **Severe dissociation** - Feeling completely disconnected from your body or reality for extended periods

### **When to Seek Immediate Help**

**If you are in immediate danger of harming yourself or others, seek help immediately. This is not a sign of weakness—it's a sign that you need additional support right now.**

In many correctional facilities, you can:
- Request to speak with mental health staff
- Use the crisis line if available
- Speak with a chaplain or counselor
- Request a medical evaluation if you're having physical symptoms

### **What Professional Support Can Offer**

- **Safety planning** - Help creating a plan to stay safe during difficult times
- **Medication** - Sometimes medication can help manage severe symptoms while you do the deeper work
- **Specialized trauma therapy** - Techniques like EMDR, trauma-focused CBT, or somatic therapy
- **Crisis intervention** - Immediate support during overwhelming moments
- **Ongoing support** - Regular check-ins as you work through the material

**Remember:** Seeking professional help doesn't mean this book isn't working. It means you're taking care of yourself and using all available resources for healing.

## **EMERGENCY SELF-CARE STRATEGIES**

### **When You Feel Overwhelmed Right Now**

1. **Stop what you're doing** - Close the book, put down the pen
2. **Use grounding immediately** - Start with 5-4-3-2-1 or box breathing
3. **Move your body** - Even if it's just standing up and stretching
4. **Get to a safe space** - If possible, move to a place where you feel safer
5. **Remind yourself: "This will pass"** - Overwhelm is temporary
6. **Don't make decisions** - When overwhelmed, don't make important decisions
7. **Focus on survival** - Right now, your only job is to get through this moment

### **When You Can't Stop Thinking About Something**

1. **Write it down** - Get it out of your head and onto paper
2. **Set a "worry time"** - Tell yourself you'll think about it at a specific time later
3. **Use distraction** - Read something unrelated, do a puzzle, focus on a task
4. **Talk to someone** - If you have someone safe, share what's on your mind
5. **Remind yourself: "I can think about this later"** - You don't have to solve everything right now

### **When You Feel Completely Numb**

1. **Don't force feelings** - Numbness is a protective response. Respect it.
2. **Do something physical** - Movement can help reconnect you to your body
3. **Use sensory input** - Hold something with texture, listen to music, notice temperature
4. **Be patient** - Feelings will return when you're ready
5. **Don't judge yourself** - Numbness is not weakness, it's protection

### **When You Feel Like Giving Up**

1. **Remember why you started** - What brought you to this work?
2. **Acknowledge how far you've come** - Even reading this book is progress
3. **Take a break** - Sometimes giving up means you need rest, not that you've failed
4. **Talk to someone** - Share your struggle with someone who understands
5. **Remember: Healing isn't linear** - Setbacks are normal. They don't mean you've failed.

## **REMEMBER: YOUR SAFETY COMES FIRST**

This healing work is important, but your safety is more important. There is no shame in:
- Taking breaks
- Pausing when overwhelmed
- Seeking additional support
- Moving slowly through the material
- Skipping sections that feel too difficult right now
- Coming back to things later when you're ready

**Healing is not a race. It's a journey. And the journey requires that you take care of yourself along the way.**

If you're ever in doubt about whether to continue or pause, **pause**. The work will still be here. Your wellbeing matters more than completing any chapter or exercise.

## **A FINAL WORD ON SAFETY**

You are doing courageous work. Facing your wounds, understanding your patterns, transforming your internal dialogue—these are not easy tasks. They require strength, courage, and self-compassion.

But courage doesn't mean pushing through when you're overwhelmed. Courage means knowing when to rest, when to pause, when to ask for help. Courage means taking care of yourself so you can continue the work.

**You are not weak if you need to pause. You are wise.**

**You are not failing if you need support. You are human.**

**You are not giving up if you take care of yourself. You are choosing to heal sustainably.**

This book is a tool. Use it wisely. Use it safely. Use it at your own pace. Your healing journey is yours, and you get to decide how to walk it.

**Take care of yourself, warrior. Your safety matters.**
